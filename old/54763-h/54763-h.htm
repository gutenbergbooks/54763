    <h2>
      ONE MOMENT PLEASE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a way, this book, &ldquo;Little Homespun,&rdquo; is a story quite by itself. In
      another way it is a sequel to &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; although you can &ldquo;catch its
      thread&rdquo; without having read a line of &ldquo;Courage.&rdquo; Now some grown people,
      and I presume some children, do not care for sequels at all, but I happen
      to know that the children who are good enough to read and care for my
      stories are fond of sequels. Those who have taken the trouble to write me,
      in little letters that are worth their weight in gold many times over,
      almost invariably ask for another book about the same people. Sometimes
      they tell me just what to put into the new story and what name to give it.
      So here lies my excuse if one is needed for writing &ldquo;Little Homespun.&rdquo;
       Besides, I could hardly help it, for there seemed to be quite a little yet
      to tell about Courage and Sylvia, and some new little friends of theirs.
      And one thing more&mdash;everything in this story that has to do with real
      people or actual events is absolutely true; a little book, named &ldquo;Historic
      Arlington,&rdquo; giving most of the information needed. Even old black Joe has
      his counterpart in Wesley Morris, one of the slaves of Mr. Custis, born on
      the estate, and employed for many years following the war as a workman
      about the grounds at Arlington.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;TWO OLD CRONIES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>UNE morning, clear
      and cool as October, and everything far and near fairly revelling in the
      early summer sunshine. The Potomac, blue as the sky above it, sparkling
      and dancing, the new young leaves on the oak trees shimmering and shining
      with the marvellous green of springtime, and the dear old Virginia
      homestead, overhanging the river, never looking <span class="pagenum">002</span><a
      name="link002" id="link002"></a>more homelike and attractive in all its
      quiet life. The reason for this did not lie all in the sunshine either.
      Just outside the door, on the wide gallery, a darling old lady sat
      knitting, for as <i>darling</i> means &ldquo;dearly beloved,&rdquo; no other word
      could so truly describe her. Everybody worshipped her and regarded her&mdash;as
      well they might&mdash;with unspeakable devotion; for darling old ladies,
      as you very well know, do not grow on every bush&mdash;quite to the
      contrary&mdash;a great many old ladies (bless their tired old hearts!)
      grow fretful and nervous and fussy, and are hard to please, not to say
      cranky. But who would blame them for this for a minute? Just as likely as
      not you and I will be cranky enough ourselves, when we have borne the
      burden of fourscore years, and are pretty well worn out in mind and spirit
      and body. But here was an old lady who was not worn out. Her hair was
      white with &ldquo;the incomparable whiteness of aged hair,&rdquo; and there were the
      indelible marks of age on the sweet, earnest face, but this dear old lady
      was &ldquo;sunny.&rdquo; She had had her own full share of sorrows and worries, and
      she had taken them all very much to heart&mdash;as people must whose
      hearts are big enough to take things to at all&mdash;and as tender as
      hearts really ought to be. But somehow or other, she had learned the <span
      class="pagenum">003</span><a name="link003" id="link003"></a>secret of not
      being overcome by the worries and the sorrows, and so, sitting there
      knitting that peerless June morning, she and the sunshine together seemed
      to glorify everything about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0015.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Presently a little specimen appeared in the doorway; a handsome little
      fellow too, though he did not have any curls, as most children do who find
      their way into story books, but his hair was golden, and, though cut quite
      short, as he insisted upon having it, had a little trick of straying down
      on his forehead in quite irresistible fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are we going to do to-day?&rdquo; said his grandmother, gazing at
      him as fondly as only fond grandmothers can. In response the little fellow
      merely pointed to two straps of gold braid upon his shoulders, and looked
      as though, really &ldquo;grand<i>na</i>na&rdquo; should have known better than to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! beg pardon, Brevet, I was so intent upon my knitting I had not
      noticed,&rdquo; and she succeeded in foiling a smile that would at least have
      proved annoying; for, as every one about the place knew, the gold
      shoulder-straps, worn in imitation of a captain&rsquo;s uniform in the army,
      meant but one thing, and that was that Captain Joe was coming down to
      carry Brevet-Captain up to Arlington for the day. Indeed at <span
      class="pagenum">004</span><a name="link004" id="link004"></a>that moment a
      cheery &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy, Brevet!&rdquo; rang out on the still morning air, and at the
      same moment a donkey and a two-wheeled cart driven by an old negro came to
      a stand at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy, Captain, I&rsquo;m ready for you. Been expecting you ev&rsquo;ry minute since
      breakfast. Good-bye, Gran<i>na</i>na, take good care of yourself,&rdquo; and a
      pair of chubby arms gave grandmamma just about as much of a hug as the old
      lady could bear up under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, Miss Lindy,&rdquo; said Captain Joe, stepping up to the gate and
      touching his cap deferentially. &ldquo;I &rsquo;spose the little un tol&rsquo; you
      I&rsquo;d like him up to Arlington fur de day if you could spare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Joe,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Ellis, smiling, &ldquo;Brevet does not think that
      necessary now-a-days. He simply dons the blue reefer with the
      shoulder-straps, and that means he has his orders for the day from his
      captain, and grandmammas are not expected to ask questions.&rdquo; Brevet stood
      by, his hands upon his hips in most independent fashion, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;That describes the case exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon he don&rsquo; mean no harm, Miss Lindy,&rdquo; said Joe, a little
      anxiously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dat much in earnest &rsquo;bout everythin&rsquo;, dat he&rsquo;s a
      Brevet-Cap&rsquo;n sure &rsquo;nuff when he gets his straps on.&rdquo; <span
      class="pagenum">005</span><a name="link005" id="link005"></a>"Oh, that&rsquo;s
      all right, Joe,&rdquo;&rsquo; answered Mrs. Ellis, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll just send for you, if
      the day comes when we need to court-martial him for insubordination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet did not at all understand this last remark, and so, touching his
      little blue cap in true soldier-fashion, turned on his heel and marched
      down to the donkey-cart as though in command of an army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brevet,&rdquo; said Joe seriously, as they jogged away from the gate, &ldquo;You mus&rsquo;
      be ver&rsquo; careful &rsquo;bout bein&rsquo; spectful like to yo&rsquo; Grand<i>na</i>na,
      case if you don&rsquo; dere&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; but any day yo&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n &rsquo;ll take
      away yo&rsquo; straps an&rsquo; den you&rsquo;d jus&rsquo; be plain Marse Howard again I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Brevet solemnly, his voice trembling a little, &ldquo;I could not
      bear it if you took away my straps,&rdquo; and he laid a little brown hand
      protectingly upon one shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, den you have a care, Honey, &lsquo;bout Miss Lindy, an&rsquo; de nex&rsquo; time Joe
      invites you down to Arlington fur de day, you des ask yo&rsquo; Grand<i>na</i>na&rsquo;s
      permission. Yo&rsquo;re my Brevet-Cap&rsquo;n sure &rsquo;nuff, but you&rsquo;re yo&rsquo; Grand<i>na</i>na&rsquo;s
      little pickaninny eb&rsquo;ry day in de week, and don&rsquo; you forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember, Captain,&rdquo; with most soldierlike submission, and then for
      awhile they drove along in silence. <span class="pagenum">006</span><a
      name="link006" id="link006"></a>Happy thoughts of anticipation, however,
      soon chased the troubled look from Brevet&rsquo;s little face, for there was
      nothing at all could compare with these occasional days spent with Joe at
      Arlington. It was owing to them that he had gained his dearly-loved title
      of Brevet and the blue soldier-cap and the shoulder-straps. Joe had been a
      member of a coloured regiment and had fought all through the war, and when
      at last he had come back and had settled down in his old cabin at
      Arlington, he was dubbed Captain, in recognition of his gallant services,
      by all the coloured folk of the neighbourhood. And Joe was by no means
      unworthy of the honour, for save for the fact that his regiment had been
      officered by white men, he might easily have risen to the command of a
      company. Time and time again in the face of the greatest danger he had
      been notoriously fearless, and had never in a single instance shown the
      white feather, which is more than can be said for many of his black
      comrades. And so from that time on it had been Captain Joe, and when some
      thirty years later little Howard Ellis came to make his home with his
      grandmother, and soon afterward came to know Joe, and to spend many a long
      summer day in his delightful company, what more natural than that the
      little fellow, with his <span class="pagenum">007</span><a name="link007"
       id="link007"></a>great passion for everything military, should first
      aspire to some of the outward insignia, and then, having attained cap and
      shoulder-straps by favour of his grandmother, should later be dowered with
      the title of &ldquo;Brevet-Captain,&rdquo; by favour of Captain Joe himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0021.jpg" alt="0021 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0021.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s des de name fur you, Honey,&rdquo; Joe had explained, &ldquo;case it&rsquo;ll
      save any con-fus&rsquo;n&rsquo; of us togedder, an&rsquo; at de same time it&rsquo;s a very
      complimentin&rsquo; title. It means es how you have it des as a sort of honour,
      widout havin&rsquo; any of de &rsquo;sponsibilities of an out-an&rsquo;-outer cap&rsquo;n
      like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that day forward it was &ldquo;Brevet-Captain,&rdquo; very tenaciously insisted
      upon by Howard himself, but gradually allowed to be abbreviated to
      &ldquo;Brevet&rdquo; within the home circle. And so Captain Joe and Brevet, having
      long ago arrived at the most satisfactory mutual understanding, sat side
      by side in the donkey-cart, without feeling the slightest obligation to
      say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road from the Ellis homestead up to Arlington lies through the woods,
      and has all the charm of a road that has been left to follow its own way&mdash;and
      a sweet, wild way at that. There were no fences, either new or old, for
      none were needed. On each side a forest of oak, interspersed with an
      occasional maple or <span class="pagenum">008</span><a name="link008"
       id="link008"></a>chestnut, stretched miles away, with seldom a glimpse of
      a clearing, while immediately bordering the road grew the veriest tangle
      of a natural hedge-row, abloom with some sort of sweet wild-flower from
      May to October. The original cut through the wood had been happily a wide
      one, and so sunshine and shower even, after all these years, still had
      abundant chance to slant this way and that across the road and coax every
      growing thing to perfection. Wood-violets, white and yellow and purple,
      peered out from under the taller growths of fern in the early springtime.
      June brought the sweet wild rose, unfolding bud after bud well into the
      summer, and the white berry-blossoms of the briars. With August came the
      berries themselves, ripening ungathered in riotous profusion, and
      following close upon them advance heralds of the goldenrod and the asters.
      It was in very truth a beautiful, dear old road, and it formed a beautiful
      setting for the little donkey-drawn cart slowly making its way along it. A
      pretty contrast, too, that of the old negro, still alert and sturdy
      notwithstanding his threescore years and ten, with the little
      golden-haired boy beside him. Together they seemed the embodiment of
      happy, confiding childhood and trustful, serene old age. <span
      class="pagenum">009</span><a name="link009" id="link009"></a>On came the
      little cart, each of its occupants apparently intent upon his own
      thoughts, until at last Brevet commenced humming a sweet little refrain;
      very softly and slowly at first, as though not quite sure of his ground,
      then more distinctly as he felt himself master of the situation. Finally
      the refrain took to itself words; words that have since grown commonplace,
      but which had all the charm of novelty for Joe, and he listened with
      absorbed delight as Brevet sang cutely,&mdash;

      his keen enjoyment for one moment interrupted, and Brevet obeyed, keeping
      the air perfectly and singing with all his heart, too, as though himself a
      veritable little pickaninny, dwelling upon the many happy memories of
      babyhood in a cotton-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clar to yo&rsquo;, Honey,&rdquo; said Joe, his voice trembling with delight, &ldquo;I can

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more, Joe, but Uncle Harry says it&rsquo;s so ordinary it doesn&rsquo;t
      belong with the first verse at all.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, dat&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said Joe, very regretfully, &ldquo;but yo&rsquo; Uncle Harry
      he do beat all for gettin&rsquo; hol&rsquo; of sweet, catchin&rsquo; music an&rsquo; I kin des

     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet put his brown hand in Joe&rsquo;s black one, his own face beaming with
      the pleasure he had given, and so the two boon companions jogged on,
      until, high on a hill before them, the pillars of a fine old house came
      into view, and a few moments later the donkey-cart drew up at a little
      cabin, just in the rear of the fine old house, a cabin that had been Joe&rsquo;s
      home ever since he was as little a fellow as Brevet there beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look around while you put Jennie up,&rdquo; explained Brevet, as soon as
      Joe had lifted him from the cart, and putting his hands in his pockets he
      walked up to the big house, straight through the hall, whose doors stood
      wide open, and out on to the porch in front. Brevet simply loved &ldquo;to look
      around,&rdquo; from that porch, and I do not think he ever stood there without
      his resolve to be a soldier some day surging up in a strong, new tide
      within him. Some of the rest of us, who are quite too old ever to think of
      being soldiers, and whose petticoats must at any age have stood in the
      way, know exactly how Brevet felt. You know, too, if you have ever been to
      Arlington, and, having been born and bred in these United States of ours,
      are the true little <span class="pagenum">012</span><a name="link012"
       id="link012"></a>American you really ought to be. But in case you never <i>have</i>
      been to Arlington, and do not at all know why it should make you feel that
      you would like to be a soldier, then let me tell you before you have read
      another single line, that Arlington is the great National Cemetery, lying
      a few miles out from Washington, and where more than fifteen thousand
      soldiers lie buried. From the moment you enter the beautiful grounds, you
      see the low mounds stretching away on every side of you, and when you
      drive up in front of Arlington House itself, there is brave General
      Sheridan&rsquo;s tomb right in front of you, so you cannot forget for a moment
      what a host of noble heroes they were, who fought in our great civil war
      thirty years ago, and how grand a thing it is lo be willing to lay down
      one&rsquo;s life if need be, for the honour of one&rsquo;s country. But perhaps you
      wonder that there should be a fine old house in a cemetery, and that
      Brevet should so love to go there, thinking a cemetery for your part
      rather sad and depressing, and wonder too why Joe should have chosen such
      a place for his home; all of which wonders it would take too much time to
      explain in this chapter, a chapter that was only meant to introduce you to
      Brevet and the Captain, so good-bye for just now to Arlington.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;COURAGE TAKES HEART.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his time, as
      before, there is a story to tell because of something braved and dared for
      Miss Julia&rsquo;s sake; something that needed less nerve, perhaps, than the
      leap Courage took that night on the drawbridge, but something that called
      not only for a world of a different sort of courage, but for infinite
      patience as well, and that claimed the whole summer for its doing. The
      reason for it all lay in four little words&mdash;Miss Julia was dead.
      Beautiful, strong, radiant Miss Julia! why, no one had thought of death
      for her, save as years and years away in the serene twilight of a calm old
      age; and yet it had come, suddenly, after a week&rsquo;s brief illness, and
      Courage was simply broken-hearted. She felt she had no right to her name
      now, and never should have again. Miss Julia had been teacher, mother,
      friend to her, one or the other almost since her babyhood, and to care for
      Miss Julia in return, now that she herself was grown up, to let every
      thing else &ldquo;come second,&rdquo; had been her only <span class="pagenum">014</span><a
      name="link014" id="link014"></a>thought. And now to find her hands
      suddenly empty, and all the sunshine gone out of her life&mdash;was it
      strange that she felt despairing and desolate and that nothing whatever
      was left?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are left,&rdquo; pleaded a chorus of little voices, and Courage seemed
      to see four brighteyed little children; bright-eyed because God had made
      them so, but with faces almost as sad as her own. &ldquo;Yes, we are left,&rdquo; they
      continued pleading. &ldquo;Miss Julia was going to do so much for us this
      summer; could not you do it in her place for her sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage shook her head gravely as in answer to her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot,&rdquo; she said, firmly. &ldquo;Everything that I leaned on is gone;
      nothing is left to me&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But could you not try just for her sake?&rdquo; chorused the little voices over
      and over in her heart, day after day, in all the sad hours of waking, and
      sometimes even in sleeping, until at last she bravely brushed the tears
      away and made answer, &ldquo;Yes, for her sake I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered the day of her six-year-old christening, when her
      remarkable name had been given her and she had asked: &ldquo;Is courage
      something that people have, Papa? Have I got it?&rdquo; and he had told her,
      &ldquo;Courage is <span class="pagenum">015</span><a name="link015" id="link015"></a>something
      that people have, dear, something fine, and I hope you will have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would try, even in this dark hour, to live up to her father&rsquo;s
      hope for her, and so her resolve was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the four bright-eyed little children knew nothing of any resolve; they
      would not have understood what it meant if they had, and as for their
      singing a pathetic little chorus in any one&rsquo;s heart, they were altogether
      unconscious of that as well. But one thing they did know, and that was
      they should never see Miss Julia again in this world, and they thought
      they also knew that a beautiful plan she had made for them could never be
      carried out. The wisest thing, therefore, for these four little people was
      to put, so far as possible, all thought of the plan from their minds, and
      Mary, the eldest of the four, said as much to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let us think about it any more,&rdquo; she urged, earnestly. &ldquo;If we
      only could have Miss Julia back what would we care for anything else?
      Besides, when you think what has happened, it seems selfish, and as though
      we did not have any hearts, to grieve over our own little plans for a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t just over our own little plan,&rdquo; insisted her younger
      brother Teddy, &ldquo;it was <span class="pagenum">016</span><a name="link016"
       id="link016"></a>Miss Julia&rsquo;s plan for us, and I don&rsquo;t think it strange a
      bit that we should grieve over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; urged Allan, who came next to Teddy in age. &ldquo;Of course us
      boys, not going to the sewing-school, did not know Miss Julia as well as
      you, but I just guess there wasn&rsquo;t a boy who thought more of her than I
      did. What&rsquo;s more I loved her; not making a fuss over her, to be sure, like
      you girls, still I did really love her,&rdquo; (emphasising the word by a shake
      of his head, and firm pursing of his lips). &ldquo;All the same, I think it&rsquo;s
      natural we should feel awfully disappointed.&rdquo; Gertrude who was seven, and
      the youngest of the four, nodded in approval of the stand Allan had taken,
      and continued nodding, as he added, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t travelled so much, seems
      to me, or had so much change in our lives as to settle back to the idea of
      a hot summer here in town, instead of going to the country, without
      feeling it a bit; that is, I don&rsquo;t think we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

      <a href="images/0035.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mary sighed and said nothing, as though ready to admit, after all, that
      perhaps it was natural that they should take their disappointment somewhat
      to heart, but the tears that had sprung suddenly into her eyes were from
      real longing for Miss Julia and not from the disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quiet talk in which the little Bennetts <span class="pagenum">017</span><a
      name="link017" id="link017"></a>were indulging, was being carried on from
      the backs of two horses&mdash;the two girls mounted upon one and the two
      boys astride the other&mdash;but they happened to be the quietest horses
      in the world; horses that never budged in fact, tailless and headless, and
      that belonged to the carpenter who lived on the first floor. The Bennetts
      lived on the top floor; but whenever there was anything to be talked over,
      down they trooped to the yard and climbed and helped each other to the
      backs of these high seats, and when all were able to declare themselves
      perfectly comfortable the conclave would commence. The little Bennetts
      were great talkers. They simply loved to discuss things, and this shows,
      when you stop to consider it, that they must be, on the whole, an amiable
      little family, for some little people that we hear of are quite too
      impatient and self-assertive to be willing to discuss things at all. But
      whatever may have been the faults of the little Bennetts they did have
      respect for each other&rsquo;s opinions, and were generally ready to admit that
      two heads were better than one, and &ldquo;Four heads,&rdquo; to quote little
      Gertrude, &ldquo;four times as better.&rdquo; This habit of discussion, for it really
      amounted to that, was partly no doubt the outcome of a little strategy on
      the part of their mother. Mary and Teddy and Allan and Gertrude were <span
      class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>just a &ldquo;pair
      of steps,&rdquo; as the saying goes, and sometimes the little living-room on the
      fourth floor seemed all too small for the noisy company, and then Mrs.
      Bennett would exclaim, and as though the most novel sort of an idea had
      occurred to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children, why don&rsquo;t you run down to the yard and have a <i>good talk?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting this appeal, such untold delights were implied in
      Mrs. Bennett&rsquo;s tone and manner, and the children seldom failed to act upon
      the advice, and what was more, seldom failed to light upon some
      interesting thing to talk about; and then, always as a last resort, some
      one could tell a story. The some one was generally Teddy, for he had the
      wildest imagination, and could upon any and every occasion invent most
      thrilling romances, which were quite as much of a surprise to himself as
      to his hearers. And so the children had come to love their perch in the
      corner of the city yard, with the uncertain shade of an old alanthus
      flickering over them in summer, and the bright sun streaming full upon
      them in its leafless winter days. And this was how it chanced that the
      Bennett children found themselves in their old haunt that breezy May
      morning, and were easing their heavy little hearts by frankly admitting to
      one <span class="pagenum">019</span><a name="link019" id="link019"></a>another
      how very great indeed was their disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better so, I think. Wrinkles come earlier and plow deeper, and thoughts
      are apt to grow bitter and morbid, when one broods and broods, and will
      not take hearts near and dear into one&rsquo;s confidence. The day never dawns
      when truly brave hearts cry out for pity, but sympathy is a sweet and
      blessed thing the world over, and God meant not only that we should have
      it, but that, if need be, we should reach our hands and grasp it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one little Bennett, however, who did not share in the general
      depression. Too short a time in the world to know aught of its joys or
      sorrows, Baby Bennett lay comfortably in his mother&rsquo;s lap, having just
      dropped off to sleep after a good half hour of rocking, Mrs. Bennett, who
      had herself grown drowsy with her low crooning over the baby, glanced
      first at the bustling little clock on the mantel shelf, and then, leaning
      her head against the back of the chair, closed her eyes; but instead of
      falling asleep she fell to thinking, and then her face grew very sad and
      tears made their way from beneath her closed eyelids. So, you see, the
      mother-heart was heavy as well as the-child-hearts in the Bennett family,
      and for the same reason. It was not because they were <span class="pagenum">020</span><a
      name="link020" id="link020"></a>not learning to face and accept the
      thought that Miss Julia, whom they so dearly loved, could not return to
      them; they were trying to be as brave as Miss Julia herself would have had
      them. But this was the day, the very day that they were all to have
      started, and they could not seem to forget it for a moment; neither could
      somebody else, and soon there came a gentle knock at Mrs. Bennett&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she answered, forgetting the tears in her eyes; and, laying the
      baby in its little clothes-basket of a bed, she turned to greet the
      newcomer. Courage had mounted the four flights of stairs very bravely, but
      the sight of the tears in Mrs. Bennett&rsquo;s eyes disarmed her, and, sinking
      into the nearest chair, she found she would best not try to speak for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry, Miss Courage, that you should have seen me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Bennett, with a world of regret in her voice; &ldquo;it is so much harder for
      you than for anybody, but this was the day, you know, almost the very
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Courage faltered; &ldquo;that was why I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you, Miss Courage; you&rsquo;ve Miss Julia&rsquo;s own thoughtfulness, but
      I&rsquo;m thinking it will be easier for us all when this day&rsquo;s over. I got rid
      of the trunk last week; it seemed to <span class="pagenum">021</span><a
      name="link021" id="link021"></a>make us all so disheartened to have it
      standing round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sell it, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed I did not, for it may be the children will have a chance yet
      some day, for a bit of an outing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided they are all to have it yet, Mrs. Bennett, this very
      summer, and just as Miss Julia planned, too. That&rsquo;s what I came to tell
      you, if you will trust them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you! Oh, my dear! but it would be too much care for those young
      shoulders; too much by far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bennett,&rdquo; said Courage, so earnestly as to carry conviction, &ldquo;I
      thought so at first, too, but the plan has grown to be just as dear to me
      as it was to Miss Julia, and now, if you do not let me carry it out, I do
      not see how I can ever live through this first summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then indeed I will let you,&rdquo; and then she added slowly, and with an
      accent on every word, &ldquo;and you are just Miss Julia&rsquo;s own child!&rdquo; and
      Courage thought them the very sweetest words she had ever heard, or ever
      could hear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I tell the children?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennett did not answer. I believe she could not, but she opened the
      window and <span class="pagenum">022</span><a name="link022" id="link022"></a>Courage
      knew that meant the children were below in their favourite corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me call them, please,&rdquo; resting one hand on Mrs. Bennett&rsquo;s arm and
      leaning far out over the sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children! come up stairs for a moment, I have something to tell you. Come
      up quickly.&rdquo; Courage hardly knew her own voice, it rang out so cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Courage!&rdquo; chorused four little voices, only this time the sound
      was in her ears as well as in her heart, and as she watched the children
      tumble helter-skelter from the horses in the yard way down below her, a
      smile that was almost merry drove the shadows from her face.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;A DELIGHTFUL DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hy, whatever&rsquo;s
      going on here?&rdquo; exclaimed Brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Joe, turning slowly round, for he knew what had attracted
      Brevet&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;I done notice it on de way up ter Ellismere fo&rsquo; you
      dis mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; den I was so took up with dat fascinatin&rsquo; song of yo&rsquo;s as
      we drove back, dat I didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt you long &rsquo;nuff to
      call yo&rsquo; attention to it. Looks as dough dere mus&rsquo; be some one come ter
      live in de pretty little house, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, it does,&rdquo; said Brevet, very much interested; &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t
      know who it is, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hasn&rsquo;t knowed nuffin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout it, till I seed de whole place
      lookin&rsquo; so pert like dis mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Joe brought old Jennie to a
      standstill that they might more fully take in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I ought to find out, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Honey, seems ter me it would <span class="pagenum">024</span><a
      name="link024" id="link024"></a>be sort of frien&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; and suiting the
      action to the word he took Brevet by the arms and dropped him down over
      the cart-wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change that had come over this point in the road was indeed
      remarkable. A little house that had remained untenanted for years, in the
      midst of an overgrown enclosure, stood this bright June morning with every
      door and window open to the air and sunshine. The vines which had half
      hidden it from view had already been cut away, and on every hand were
      signs that the place was being brought into liveable shape with all
      possible expedition. No one was in sight, so Brevet noiselessly pushed
      open the gate, and, making his way to the little front porch, reached
      upward and lifted the brass knocker of the open door. The unexpected sound
      instantly brought a neatly-dressed, elderly-looking woman from some room
      in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0045.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy,&rdquo; said Brevet, instantly put at his ease by the kindness of the
      woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, dear?&rdquo; she asked, with a puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said how&rsquo;dy,&rdquo; explained Brevet, wondering that the woman&rsquo;s face still
      wore the puzzled look. &ldquo;We just stopped to ask who was coming. We go by
      here very often, Joe and I,&rdquo; pointing to the cart, &ldquo;and we were <span
      class="pagenum">025</span><a name="link025" id="link025"></a>wondering
      what was up seeing this place open that&rsquo;s been closed so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that Miss Julia&rsquo;s self is a comin&rsquo; can it?&rdquo; called Joe, for
      the little house was not set so far back from the road but that he could
      hear every word spoken between the woman and Brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did you know Miss Julia?&rdquo; she asked, stepping at once to the gate,
      with Brevet following close behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss; dat is not personally, but I knowed dat Miss Julia owned dis
      little plantation, an&rsquo; I often wonder dat she never done come to live on
      it. I can &lsquo;member when her Uncle Dave was livin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it was den des de <i>homiest</i>
      little homestead in de country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not heard then of Miss Julia&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, with as much feeling in his voice as though Miss
      Julia had indeed been an old friend; &ldquo;you don&rsquo; tell me! I&rsquo;se often heard
      what a reg&rsquo;lar lady she was, and often wished I done have a chance to lay
      eyes on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a very good friend to me,&rdquo; said the woman, sorrowfully, &ldquo;and she
      had expected to come down here this summer and open the house, and bring a
      little family of city children with her who had never spent a day in the
      real country in their lives.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">026</span><a
      name="link026" id="link026"></a>"You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said Joe, shaking his
      head sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange what times de Lord chooses to call de good folks
      out of dis worl&rsquo;.&rdquo; And then he added, after a moment of respectful
      silence, &ldquo;But de place here, am it sold to some new party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Miss Julia left it in her will to a young lady who was just the same
      as a daughter to her, and she has decided to come down in Miss Julia&rsquo;s
      place this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring the little children?&rdquo; asked Brevet, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring the little children,&rdquo; answered the woman, her face brightening.
      &ldquo;I have come down to make everything ready for them, and they are coming
      on Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you think I could know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can know them. You must come and see them so soon as ever
      they come. But you must tell me your name so that I can tell them about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Howard Ellis, but that name isn&rsquo;t any use now. Everybody calls
      me Brevet since I and the Captain here have grown to be such friends. It
      means kind of an officer in the army, and when I grow up I&rsquo;m going to West
      Point and learn how to be a real officer, and not just kind of a one at
      all. But till then everybody&rsquo;s going to call me Brevet. And <span
      class="pagenum">027</span><a name="link027" id="link027"></a>now what is
      your name please, and the children&rsquo;s, because I want to tell my grand<i>na</i>na
      all about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my name is Mary Duff, dear, and the children are named Bennett&mdash;Mary
      and Teddy and Allan and Gertrude Bennett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are two of them boys?&rdquo; and Brevet&rsquo;s face was radiant. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had
      a boy to play with ever hardly, but I s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;re older boys than me,&rdquo;
       he added, a little crestfallen; &ldquo;almost all boys are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Teddy is not very much older, just a little, and Allan is just
      about your age I should say. Never you fear, Brevet, you&rsquo;ll have beautiful
      times with them all, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I come then?&rdquo; wishing to have matters very definitely
      arranged. &ldquo;Do you think they would like to have me here to help them feel
      at home right off at the very first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should not wonder but they would like that very much indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will come on Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you will ask your gran<i>na</i>na, Brevet,&rdquo; said Joe,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I mean I will ask if I may come.&rdquo; This last very quickly and
      eagerly, remembering his little lecture of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s des a comfort to see de ole place in shape once more, an&rsquo; I
      trus&rsquo; you an&rsquo; de <span class="pagenum">028</span><a name="link028"
       id="link028"></a>young lady an&rsquo; de chilluns will have des a beautiful
      summer. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps some day,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s eyes twinkled with the thought,
      &ldquo;dey&rsquo;ll all come up and spen&rsquo; de day with me at Arlington. Brevet here
      alway des loves to come. You know Arlington&rsquo;s where all de soldiers am
      buried. I used to be a slave on de place &lsquo;fo&rsquo; de wah, an&rsquo; dere ain&rsquo;t much
      happened dere fur de las&rsquo; fifty years dat I hasn&rsquo;t some knowledge of, and
      dey done tell me&rdquo; (indulging in a little complacent chuckle) &ldquo;dat it&rsquo;s
      mighty interestin&rsquo; ter spen&rsquo; de day with Joe at Arlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, indeed I should think it would be,&rdquo; said Mary, very much
      interested, &ldquo;and I wish you would stop and see Miss Courage about it the
      first time you drive by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, Miss; and now. Brevet, your gran<i>na</i>na will be
      watchin&rsquo; fur us an&rsquo; we had bes&rsquo; be joggin&rsquo; on I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Captain,&rdquo; clambering into the cart, and then Joe and Brevet
      courteously touched their caps, in true military fashion, and old Jenny
      jogged on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss <i>Courage</i> did she say?&rdquo; asked Brevet, the moment they were out
      of hearing, just as Joe knew he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it soun&rsquo; like dat, Honey, but some day we must make inquiries. Dere
      mus&rsquo; be some &lsquo;splanation of a name like dat.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;EVERYBODY HAPPY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is strange and
      beautiful,&rdquo; thought Courage as she moved busily about her room, putting
      one thing and another into a trunk that stood open before the fireplace;
      &ldquo;strange and beautiful how difficulties take to themselves wings, when you
      once make up your mind what is right to do and then go straight ahead and
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Courage,&rdquo; said a young coloured girl, who was leaning over the bed
      trying to fold a black dress in a fashion that should leave no creases to
      show for its packing, &ldquo;I felt all along there was nothing else for you to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Sylvia, why did you not say so?&rdquo; Courage asked, a little sharply.
      &ldquo;You knew how hard it was for me to come to any decision. It was not
      because you were afraid to say so, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; and a merry look shone for a moment in Sylvia&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;No, I
      don&rsquo;t believe I ever could grow afraid of the little curly-headed girl I
      used to work for when we <span class="pagenum">030</span><a name="link030"
       id="link030"></a>were both children together. No, indeed; it was only
      because I thought you ought to see it so yourself. It seemed as though it
      was just as plain a duty as the hand before your face, and I felt sure you
      would come to it, as you have, if we only gave you time enough.&rdquo; It was a
      comfort to Courage to feel that Sylvia so thoroughly understood her.
      Indeed, they were far more to each other than mistress and maid; they were
      true friends these two, whose only home for a while had been Larry Starr&rsquo;s
      brave lighter, and for both of whom he had cared in the same kind,
      fatherly way. Of course you do not understand about Larry or Larry&rsquo;s
      lighter, unless you have read &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; but then on the other hand there
      is no reason why you need to understand. Nor was Sylvia the only one who
      approved of what Courage had done. The Elversons, Miss Julia&rsquo;s brother and
      his wife, and with whom Courage and Miss Julia had lived, were as glad as
      glad could be to have Courage carry out Miss Julia&rsquo;s plan; and so in fact
      was everybody who saw how sad and lonely Courage was, and what a blessing
      anything that would occupy her thoughts must be to her. And so, in the
      light of all this, you can see how sad it would have been if Courage had
      yielded to her fears, and persistently turned away <span class="pagenum">031</span><a
      name="link031" id="link031"></a>from a duty, in very truth as plain as the
      hand before your face, as Sylvia had put it. But Courage had not turned
      away, nor for one instant wavered from the moment her resolve was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now at last the day for the start had dawned. The little Bennetts had
      been awake at sunrise. Fancy having three months of Christmas ahead of you&mdash;for
      it seemed just as fine as that to them. It was a wonder they had slept at
      all. They had read about brooks and hills and valleys, and woods where all
      manner of beautiful wild things were growing; of herds of cow&rsquo;s grazing in
      grassy pastures; of loads of hay with children riding atop of them, and of
      the untold delights of a hay-loft. And now they were going to know and
      enjoy every one of these delights for themselves. Why, they could not even
      feel sad about leaving their mother, and indeed she was as radiant as they
      at the thought of their going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained to them, &ldquo;I shall have the baby for company, and
      such a beautiful time to rest; and your father and I will take a sail now
      and then down the bay, or go to the park for the day in the very warm
      weather; and then it is going to be such a comfort to have your father
      home for two whole months, and that couldn&rsquo;t have happened <span
      class="pagenum">032</span><a name="link032" id="link032"></a>either, you
      know, if you had not been going away for the summer.&rdquo; The children&rsquo;s
      father, Captain Bennett, was one of the pilots who earn their living by
      bringing the great ocean steamers into the harbour, and often he would be
      aboard the pilot-boat, at sea for weeks at a time, waiting his turn to
      take the helm of one of the incoming steamers, and then, as like as not,
      he would have to put straight to sea again, for there were many to keep,
      and there was need for every hard-earned dollar. But the Captain&rsquo;s chance
      for a vacation had come with the children&rsquo;s. He could afford to take it,
      since four of his little family were to be provided for, for the entire
      summer, and so every one was happy and every one believed that somehow
      Miss Julia must know and be so glad for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was the day for the start, as I told you, and the children had
      started. They were in the waiting-room at the foot of Cortlandt Street,
      where Courage was to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here she is,&rdquo; exclaimed Mary, with a great sigh of relief, being the
      first to espy Courage coming through the gate of the ferry-house, &ldquo;and
      doesn&rsquo;t she look lovely!&rdquo; Mary was right; Courage did look lovely as, with
      Sylvia close behind her, she walked the length of the waiting-room to
      where the little group <span class="pagenum">033</span><a name="link033"
       id="link033"></a>were standing. Other people thought so too, as she
      passed, and watched her with keenest interest. Her stylish black dress and
      black sailor hat were wonderfully becoming, and the face that had been so
      pale and sad was flushed with pleasure now, and with the rather
      uncomfortable consciousness that she and her little party could scarcely
      fail to be the observed of all observers. Mrs. Bennett was there, of
      course, to see them off, and the baby and the Captain, and it must be
      confessed that the eyes of both father and mother grew a little misty as
      they said &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to their little flock. The girl contingent was a
      trifle misty, too, but the baby was the only one who really cried
      outright. However, I half believe that was because he wanted a banana that
      hung in a fruit stand near by, and not at all because the children were
      going to leave him; some babies seem to have so very little feeling. But
      now it was time to go aboard the boat, and the Captain and Mrs. Bennett
      saw the last of the little party as they disappeared within the ferry-boat
      cabin, and then in fifteen minutes more the same little party was ranged
      along one side of a parlor car on the &ldquo;Washington Limited&rdquo;; then the
      wheels slowly and noiselessly commenced to turn and they were really off;
      all of the little party&rsquo;s hearts thrilling <span class="pagenum">034</span><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a>with the thought, and all sitting up as
      prim as you please, in their drawing-room chairs, quite overawed with the
      magnificence of their surroundings and the unparalleled importance of the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage, very much amused, watched them for a few moments and then
      suggested that they should settle themselves for the journey. Bags were
      stowed away in the racks overhead, coats and hats banished to coat hooks,
      and one thing and another properly adjusted, until at last four little
      pair of hands having placed four little footstools at exactly the desired
      angle, four pair of brand-new russet shoes found a resting-place rather
      conspicuously atop of them, and the four children leaned comfortably back
      in the large, upholstered chairs as though now at last permanently
      established for the entire length of the journey. But of course no amount
      of adjusting and arranging really meant anything of that sort, or that
      they could be able to sit still for more than five minutes at a time, and
      Courage and Sylvia soon had to put their wits to work to think up ways of
      keeping the restless little company in some sort of order. But fortunately
      none of the fellow-passengers appeared disturbed thereby. On the contrary,
      they seemed very much interested, and finally a handsome <span
      class="pagenum">035</span><a name="link035" id="link035"></a>old gentleman
      came down the aisle, and leaning over the chair in which Courage was
      sitting, said courteously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, if you will pardon an old man&rsquo;s curiosity, and do not
      for any reason mind telling me, I should very much like to know what you
      are doing, and where you are going with this little family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am very glad to tell you,&rdquo; answered Courage cordially, for since
      that summer spent with Larry there had always been such a very warm corner
      in her heart for all old people; and Teddy, who was sitting next to
      Courage, had the grace to offer the old gentleman a chair. Then for some
      time he listened intently, his kind old face glowing with pleasure as
      Courage told him all about the children, and finally of the cosy little
      cottage awaiting their coming down in Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in doing all this,&rdquo; Courage concluded, &ldquo;I am simply carrying out the
      plans of my dearest friend, Miss Julia Everett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; the old gentleman exclaimed, his voice trembling.
      &ldquo;I knew Miss Everett well. She always stopped with me when she came to
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be that you are old Colonel Anderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Colonel Anderson, and I suppose <span class="pagenum">036</span><a
      name="link036" id="link036"></a>I am old,&rdquo; he added, smiling; &ldquo;and can it
      be you are young Miss Courage, of whom I have heard so often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Courage, but you will excuse me, won&rsquo;t you, for speaking as I
      did? I only had happened to hear Miss Julia&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courage hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, dear child, I understand perfectly. You used to hear Miss Julia
      speak of me as old Colonel Anderson, and so I am, and I am not ashamed of
      it either, although I could not resist the temptation to tease you a
      little, which was very rude of me. But now, can it be that it is to Miss
      Julia&rsquo;s estate near Arlington that you are going&mdash;to the home that
      her Uncle Everett left her when she was just a little slip of a girl,
      years before the war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is exactly where, but I have never seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will love it when you do. It is the dearest little spot in the
      world. I will drive out some day and take luncheon with you and the
      children, if I should happen to have an invitation. I could tell you some
      interesting things about the old place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, will you come?&rdquo; exclaimed Mary and Gertrude in one breath, for with a
      curiosity as pardonable, I think, as that of old Mr. Anderson, all of the
      children had grouped themselves <span class="pagenum">037</span><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a>about Courage, and had listened with
      keenest interest to every word spoken. And so one more happy anticipation
      was added to the many with which their happy hearts were overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the train steamed into Washington, although at times it had seemed
      to the children as though it never would, and then a carriage was soon
      secured, and, three on a seat, the little party crowded into it, and they
      were off for their eight mile drive to Arlington.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;HOWDY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd meantime what
      excitement in the little cottage down in Virginia! Everything was in
      readiness and everybody was on the tiptoe of expectation. Everybody meant
      Mary Duff, (it was she, you know, who had cared for little Courage through
      all her babyhood, and who had been sent down to get everything in order),
      and besides Mary Duff, Mary Ann the cook, old Joe and Brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed, Brevet had had a little difficulty in winning his
      grandmother&rsquo;s consent to this visit, but he had been able to meet every
      objection with such convincing arguments, that he had come off victor in
      the encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Grand<i>na</i>na,&rdquo; he had confidentially explained, with his
      pretty little half-southern, half-darkey accent, &ldquo;I is a perfec&rsquo; stranger
      to them now I know, but then everything is strange to them down here, so
      don&rsquo;t you s&rsquo;pose it would be nice for me to be right there waiting at the
      gate, where I can call out <span class="pagenum">039</span><a
      name="link039" id="link039"></a>&lsquo;How&rsquo;dy&rsquo; just so soon as ever they come in
      sight, and so for me not to be a stranger to them more&rsquo;n the first minute,
      and have them find there are folks here who are very glad to know them
      right from the start? Besides, the lady&mdash;Mary Duff was her name&mdash;told
      me she just knew those little Bennetts would love to see me, and that she
      would surely expect me down to-day for certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so &ldquo;Grand<i>na</i>na&rdquo; succumbed, not having the heart to nip such
      noble hospitality in the bud, and at two o&rsquo;clock precisely, the best
      carriage wheeled up to the door and Mammy and Brevet were quickly stowed
      away within it, to say nothing of a basketful of good things covered with
      a huge napkin of fine old damask. But who is Mammy? you ask, and indeed
      you should have been told pages ago, for no one for many years had been
      half so important as Mammy in the Ellis household. She is an old negro
      woman, almost as old as Joe himself, and when on the first of January,
      1863, President Lincoln issued the proclamation that made all the slaves
      free, she was among the first to turn her back upon the plantation where
      she was raised, and make her way to Washington. It was there that Mrs.
      Ellis had found her, when in search of a nurse for her two little boys,
      and from that day to this she has been the faithful worshipper of the
      whole Ellis family. Now in her old age her one and only duty has been to
      care for Brevet, a care constantly lessening as that little fellow daily
      proves his ability to look out more and more for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brevet was not to be allowed, however, on the occasion of this first visit
      to their new neighbours, to make the trip alone. &ldquo;Grand<i>na</i>na&rdquo; had
      been very firm about that, somewhat to his chagrin, and so, if the truth
      be told, Mammy&rsquo;s presence in the comfortable, old-fashioned carriage was
      at first simply tolerated. But that state of affairs did not last long.
      Try as he would, Brevet was too happy at heart to cherish any grievance,
      imaginary or otherwise, for many minutes together; and soon he and Mammy
      were chatting away in the merriest fashion, and the old nurse was looking
      forward to the unusual excitement of the day, with quite as much
      expectation as her little charge of seven. Had she not devoted the leisure
      of two long mornings of preparation to the shelling of almonds and the
      stoning of raisins, and then when the day came, with eager trembling
      hands, packed all the good things away in the great, roomy hamper that
      seemed now to look at her so <span class="pagenum">041</span><a
      name="link041" id="link041"></a>complacently from the opposite seat of the
      phaeton? Yes, indeed, it was every whit as glad a day for Mammy as Brevet,
      and she peered out from the carriage just as anxiously as they drove up to
      the gate and Mary Duff came out to greet them. But Mammy had something to
      say before making any motion to leave the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, Miss, dat dis yere little pickaninny of ours ain&rsquo;t
      gwine to be in any one&rsquo;s way or nuffin?&rdquo; she asked, bowing a how-do-you-do
      to Mary, and keeping a restraining hand upon Brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He done told us you wanted him very much,&rdquo; but in a half-questioning
      tone, as though what Brevet &ldquo;done told them&rdquo; was sometimes &ldquo;suspicioned&rdquo;
       of being slightly coloured by what he himself would like to do,
      notwithstanding his general high standard of truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brevet is perfectly right&mdash;we do want him very much,&rdquo; Mary answered,
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if you have to take his old Mammy &lsquo;long wid him, kase Miss Lindy
      wasn&rsquo;t quite willin to &lsquo;low him ter come by hisself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re very glad to see you, Mammy,&rdquo; Mary answered cordially, and so
      the last of Mammy&rsquo;s scruples, which were not as real as <span
      class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>Mammy herself
      tried to think them, were put to rest, and Brevet was permitted to
      scramble out of the carriage, while Mary Duff lent a hand to Mammy&rsquo;s more
      difficult alighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is dere ere a man &lsquo;bout could lift dis yere basket ter de house for us?&rdquo;
       she asked, looking helplessly up to the hamper, &ldquo;kase Daniel dere has
      instructions from de Missus neber to leave de hosses less&rsquo;n dere ain&rsquo;t no
      way to help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess dere is,&rdquo; chuckled a familiar voice behind her back, and
      Mammy turned to discover Joe close beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I klar, you heah!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, it seems like de whole
      county turn out to welcome dese yere little Bennetts. Seems, too, like
      some of us goin&rsquo; to be in de way sure &lsquo;nuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howsomever, some on us don&rsquo; take up so much room as oders,&rdquo; grunted Joe,
      surmising, and quite correctly, too, that Mammy considered his presence on
      the scene something wholly unnecessary and undesirable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;se heah to help
      wid de trunks, Mammy,&rdquo; he then added; &ldquo;what you heah to help wid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mammy, scorning the insinuation, turned to Mary Duff as they walked up the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Honey, de Lord ain&rsquo;t lef&rsquo; no choice ter most on us as ter what
      size we&rsquo;ll be, <span class="pagenum">043</span><a name="link043"
       id="link043"></a>but pears like you&rsquo;d better be a fat ole Mammy like me,
      than such a ole bag o&rsquo; bones as Joe yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0067.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      But Joe by that time was depositing his basket in the hall-way of the
      cottage, and was fortunately quite beyond the fire of this personal
      attack. Mary Duff was naturally much amused at the real but harmless
      jealousy of these old coloured folk, and realised for perhaps the five
      hundredth time what children we all are, be race and nationality what they
      may.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Brevet had taken his position on the top rail of the gate, with
      one arm around a slim little cedar that stood guard beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I stand right out here, Miss Duff,&rdquo; he called back to Mary, &ldquo;so as to
      see them a long way off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, yes!&rdquo; Mary answered, quite certain in her mind that
      since Courage herself was a little girl she never had seen such a dear
      child. Brevet&rsquo;s watch was a brief one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming! Hear the wheels! They are coming,&rdquo; he cried exultingly,
      with almost the next breath. In just two minutes more they really <i>had
      come</i>, and Brevet was calling out &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy, how&rsquo;dy, how&rsquo;dy&rdquo; at the top
      of his strong little lungs, to the wide-eyed <span class="pagenum">044</span><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a>amazement of the Bennetts, who had never
      heard this Southern abbreviation of the Northern &ldquo;How-do-you-do.&rdquo; Then
      jumping down from his perch, he ran up to the carriage, repeating over
      again his cordial welcoming &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;dy, dear little stranger!&rdquo; replied Courage, waving a greeting to
      Mary; &ldquo;and who are you I would like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Howard Stanhope Ellis, but that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re to call me, I have
      another name. It&rsquo;s the name they give&mdash;&rdquo; but he did not finish his
      sentence, for charming little fellow though he was, he could not be
      allowed to monopolise things in this fashion, and Mary gently pushed him
      aside to get him out of her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so here you are at last,&rdquo; she said joyously; &ldquo;welcome home, Miss
      Courage. How are you, Sylvia?&rdquo; while she bent down with a cordial kiss for
      each friendly little Bennett. Meantime Courage was making friends with
      Brevet, and a moment later the children were crowding close about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;m glad to see you all,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an emphasising shake
      of his head, &ldquo;and I think I know who&rsquo;s who too. I believe this is
      Gertrude,&rdquo; laying one little brown hand on Gertrude&rsquo;s sleeve, &ldquo;and you are
      Mary, because Mary&rsquo;s the oldest, and you <span class="pagenum">045</span><a
      name="link045" id="link045"></a>Teddy, because Teddy comes next, and you&mdash;you
      are Allan.&rdquo; Brevet had learned his lesson from Mary Duff quite literally
      by heart, and altogether vanquished by his&rsquo; joyous, friendly greeting, the
      children vied with each other in giving him the loudest kiss and the very
      hardest hug, but from that first moment of meeting it was an accepted fact
      that Allan held first place. There was no gainsaying the special
      joyousness of his &ldquo;And you&mdash;you are Allan.&rdquo; The boy play-fellow for
      whom he had hitherto longed in vain had come, and to little Brevet it
      seemed as though the millennium had come with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Joe and Mammy, barely tolerating each other&rsquo;s presence,
      waited respectfully in the background, so that Mary had a chance to
      explain who they were, as Courage stood in the path, delightedly looking
      up at the dear little house that was to be her home. But Sylvia had
      already made their acquaintance. After paying the driver and making sure
      that nothing had been left in the carriage, she went straight toward them.
      &ldquo;I thought I should find some of my own people down here in Virginia,&rdquo; she
      said, cordially extending a hand to each as she spoke, &ldquo;but I did not
      expect they would be right on the spot, the very first moment, to welcome
      me,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">046</span><a name="link046" id="link046"></a>"Miss
      Duff done tol&rsquo; us &lsquo;bout Miss Sylvy bein&rsquo; of de party,&rdquo; said Joe with great
      elegance of manner, while Mammy looked daggers at him, for replying to a
      remark which she considered addressed chiefly to herself. It was queer
      enough, the attitude of these two oldtime slaves toward each other, and
      yet to be accounted for, I think, in their eagerness to be of use to those
      whom they claimed the privilege of serving; and each was conscious, by a
      subtle intuition, of a determination to outwit the other if possible in
      this regard&mdash;which was all very well, if they only could have
      competed in the right sort of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no more time in this chapter for Mammy or Joe, nor anything
      else for that matter. Indeed, it would take quite a chapter of itself if I
      should try to tell you of the unpacking of Grandma Ellis&rsquo;s basket, and
      then of the children&rsquo;s merry supper; but it seems to me there are more
      important things for me to write about, and for you to read about, than
      things to eat and of how the children ate them. By nine o&rsquo;clock quiet
      reigned in the little cottage, and &ldquo;the children were nestled as snug in
      their beds&rdquo; as the little folk in &ldquo;The Night before Christmas.&rdquo; Joe and
      Mammy and Brevet had long ago gone home, and Courage and Mary Duff were
      sitting together in the <span class="pagenum">047</span><a name="link047"
       id="link047"></a>little living-room, while Sylvia, in the hall just
      outside, was busy arranging the books they had brought with them, on some
      hanging shelves.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this has been the happiest day in all my life,&rdquo; said Courage. &ldquo;I
      have simply forgotten everything in the pleasure of those children.&rdquo; And
      then, sitting down at the little cottage piano and running her hands for a
      few moments over the keys, she sang softly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;For all the Saints, who from their labour rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet, familiar hymn brought Sylvia to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Courage,&rdquo; she said, standing with her arms folded behind her back,
      as she had always a way of standing when deeply interested, &ldquo;you have
      forgotten yourself and your sorrow to-day, but not for one moment have you
      really forgotten Miss Julia,&rdquo; and Courage knew that this was true, and
      closed the little piano with tears in her eyes and a wondrous joy and
      peace in her heart.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;ARLINGTON BEFORE THE WAR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner were our
      little New Yorkers settled in their pretty summer home than they naturally
      desired that it should have a name, and after much discussion, according
      to the Bennett custom, they all agreed that &ldquo;Little Homespun,&rdquo; one of the
      names that Courage had suggested, seemed to fit the cosy, unpretentious
      little home better than anything else that had been thought of. No sooner
      were they settled either before they became friends firm and fast of the
      household up at Ellismere. It needed but very little time to bring that
      about, because everything was&mdash;to use a big word because no smaller
      one will do&mdash;propitious. You can imagine what it meant to Courage&mdash;taking
      up her home in a new land, and with cares wholly new to her&mdash;to have
      a dear old lady like Grandma Ellis call upon her, as she did the very
      first morning after her arrival. Of course Courage had to explain how it
      was she had come way down there to Virginia with the little Bennett
      children in <span class="pagenum">049</span><a name="link049" id="link049"></a>charge.
      Indeed, almost before she knew it, and in answer to Grandma Ellis&rsquo;s gentle
      inquiries, she had told her all there was to tell&mdash;about Miss Julia,
      about herself and Mary Duff and Sylvia, and finally, as always with any
      new friend, the why and wherefore of her own unusual name. The tears stood
      in Grandma Ellis&rsquo;s eyes many times during the narration, and her face was
      aglow with love and sympathy and admiration as Courage brought her story
      to a close.

    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;I want you should know what little
      there is to tell about <i>us</i>. We live just three miles from here, and
      in the same old Virginia homestead where my husband was born. We, means my
      son Harry, and Brevet and myself. Brevet, as you already know, perhaps,
      has neither father nor mother. His mother died when he was six months old,
      and his father, my oldest son, was drowned when the <i>Utopia</i> went
      down, off the coast of Spain five years ago. We are doing our best, Harry
      and I, to make up to Brevet for his great loss; but it is sad that the
      little fellow should only know the love of an old grandmama like me, and
      never of his own young mother. But I do not want to burden you with my
      sorrows, dear child; I only want you to know we must all be the best of
      friends <span class="pagenum">050</span><a name="link050" id="link050"></a>the
      whole summer through. It seems to me we just need each other, and in order
      to commence right, you must all come and spend the day with us to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on the morrow they all did go up to Ellismere, Mary Duff and Sylvia
      with the others; the children went again the day after that, and then all
      hands from Ellismere came down to Homespun for the day, and so what with
      constant coming and going from one house to the other, in just two weeks&rsquo;
      time it was as though they had known each other always. And then it was
      that Joe arranged with Courage for the day to be spent at Arlington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ellis&rsquo;s will all come,&rdquo; Joe explained, &ldquo;Mammy wid de res&rsquo; of &lsquo;em, I
      suppose,&rdquo; (but very much as though he preferred she should not) &ldquo;and I
      done wish de Colonel could be persuaded to drive out from Washington, case
      &lsquo;tween us we knows mos&rsquo; dere is of interest happened at Arlington. He use&rsquo;
      to visit at de big house when General Lee lived in it &rsquo;fo&rsquo; de wah,
      an&rsquo; I was a slave on de place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Colonel Anderson, do you, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De berry same, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, of course he&rsquo;ll come. He is an old, old friend of Miss
      Julia&rsquo;s. I met him on <span class="pagenum">051</span><a name="link051"
       id="link051"></a>the train when we came down and he asked me to invite him
      out some time,&rdquo; and so Courage wrote a note of invitation that very day
      which Joe, with his own hands, carried into Washington. It was written on
      pretty blue paper, which had &ldquo;Homespun&rdquo; engraved at the top of the sheet
      and Tiffany&rsquo;s mark on the envelope as well. It must be confessed that
      Courage had a little extravagant streak in her; that is, she loved to have
      everything just about as nearly right as she could. Sister Julia had
      encouraged the little streak, knowing the peculiar pleasure that the
      reasonable indulgence of a refined taste brings into life, &ldquo;but, dear,&rdquo;
       she had often said to Courage, &ldquo;there is one thing to look out for, and
      that is that the more you gratify your own taste the more you must give to
      the people who have no taste at all, or very little of anything that makes
      life enjoyable,&rdquo; all of which good advice Courage had taken to heart and
      remembered. But extravagant streak or no, the stylish little blue note
      accomplished its purpose, for at precisely nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning
      Colonel Anderson wheeled up at Joe&rsquo;s cabin, in his high, old-fashioned
      carriage, and at almost the same moment arrived the Homespun buckboard
      with its load of eight (for Sylvia and Mary Duff were to be in <span
      class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a>as many good
      times as possible) and a moment later Grandma Ellis, Harry, Brevet and old
      Mammy drove upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how would we best manage things, Joe?&rdquo; asked Colonel Anderson, after
      everybody had had a. little chat with everybody else, and luncheon baskets
      and wraps had been safely stowed away in Joe&rsquo;s cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, seems ter me we&rsquo;d better take a look over de house first, den take
      a stroll through de groun&rsquo;s an&rsquo; come back to de shade of dat ol&rsquo; ches&rsquo;nut
      yonder for de story. You can&rsquo;t make a story bery interestin&rsquo; when you hab
      a walkin&rsquo; aujence, an&rsquo; de aujence what&rsquo;s walkin&rsquo; can&rsquo;t catch on ter de
      story bery well either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to see that this suggestion was a wise one, so with the
      exception of Grandma Ellis and Mammy, for whom comfortable rocking-chairs
      were at once placed under the chestnut tree, the little party made its way
      into the old colonial house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arlington House is rather a cheerless looking place now, I admit,&rdquo; sighed
      Colonel Anderson, as they walked through the large empty rooms, &ldquo;but wait
      till we have the story and we&rsquo;ll fill it full enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t let us wait any longer than we have to,&rdquo; answered Courage,
      and as this was the sentiment of the entire party, they <span
      class="pagenum">053</span><a name="link053" id="link053"></a>hurried from
      the house for the walk that was to follow. The four little Bennetts kept
      close to each other all the way, Mary, the eldest, leading little Gertrude
      by the hand. They were very quiet, too, wondering and overawed by the
      unbroken lines of graves on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Teddy and I will have to go to a war when we grow up,&rdquo; said
      Allan at last, half under his breath, with a perceptible little shiver and
      as though barely mustering courage to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go if there is a war, I can tell you that,&rdquo; Teddy replied, rather
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be buried here, I suppose,&rdquo; and Allan shook his head
      hopelessly, as though standing that moment at the foot of their two
      soldier-graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; affirmed Brevet, who had kept his place close beside his
      favourite Allan from the start. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to be buried right by both of
      you, too, just as though I was one of your family,&rdquo; and Brevet stood as he
      spoke with his arms folded and his brows knit, in solemn and soldier-like
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then the little party would group itself around Colonel Anderson
      as he read the inscription from some monument or headstone, telling of the
      valour of the man whose grave it marked and often of the brave deed <span
      class="pagenum">054</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>dared that
      cost the hero his life. And so some idea was gained of the beauty and
      significance of the great soldier cemetery, and then all hurried back to
      Grandma Ellis, and Colonel Anderson began his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd assortment of rush-bottomed chairs had been brought from Joe&rsquo;s
      cabin for the grown-ups, and the children were scattered about on shawls
      and carriage rugs on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, it isn&rsquo;t easy,&rdquo; said Colonel Anderson thoughtfully, &ldquo;to know just
      where to commence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Joe, who was seated at the Colonel&rsquo;s elbow.
      &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t no such proper place ter begin as at de beginnin&rsquo;. Tell &lsquo;em as
      how der was a time when Arlington was a great unbroken forest, an&rsquo; how way
      back early in de eighteen hundreds, George Washington Parke Custis came by
      de lan&rsquo; through his father and built Arlington House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going as far back as that, Joe, you ought to go farther, and
      tell how there was an old house here even before this one, which was built
      way back early in the seventeen hundreds. It was a little house, with only
      four rooms, and it stood down yonder near the bank of the river, and was
      bought <span class="pagenum">055</span><a name="link055" id="link055"></a>with
      the land by John Custis from the Alexanders. John Custis, you know,
      children, was Martha Washington&rsquo;s son, for she was a widow with two
      children when she married General Washington; and George Washington Parke
      Custis, who lived for awhile in the little house before he built this
      beautiful big one, was her grandson. He was a fortunate young fellow, as
      the world counts being fortunate, for he had more money than he knew what
      to do with. As soon as this fine house was completed, George Custis was
      married and brought his bride to his new home, where for the next fifty
      years they lived the most happy and contented life imaginable. They had
      one daughter, a very beautiful young lady, as I myself clearly remember,
      for my birthday and her wedding-day fell together, and that was why I was
      allowed to attend the wedding. My mother and Miss Mollie&rsquo;s mother were the
      warmest friends, but I was only a boy of ten, and would have been left at
      home, I think, but for the coincidence of the birthday. I remember my
      mother told me Miss Custis said she would like me always to think of her
      wedding-day, when my birthday came round, and I can tell you, children, I
      always do, even though I am an old man and have started in the seventies.&rdquo;
       <span class="pagenum">056</span><a name="link056" id="link056"></a>"An&rsquo; so
      do I,&rdquo; chimed in Joe; &ldquo;I neber done think of one without de oder, so
      closely are dey &rsquo;sociated in my min&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, were you there too, Joe?&rdquo; asked Brevet, with a merry little twinkle
      in his eyes, for if there was one story more often told than any other for
      Brevet&rsquo;s edification, it was the story of Miss Mary Custis&rsquo;s wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho&rsquo; as yo&rsquo; born, Honey,&rdquo; quite overlooking Brevet&rsquo;s insinuation in his
      absorbing interest in the subject. &ldquo;It was a bery busy day for me, de day
      Miss Mollie was married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ole was you, Joe, &lsquo;bout dat time?&rdquo; asked Mammy, her old eyes
      a-twinkle with mischief as well as Brevet&rsquo;s, for Joe&rsquo;s age, as every one
      knew, was a mere matter of guesswork, so careful was he that no one should
      ever come to a knowledge of the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems ter me dat question ain&rsquo;t no wise relavent,&rdquo; replied Joe, bristling
      up a little, &ldquo;but de Colonel and I warn&rsquo;t so bery far apart when we was
      chilluns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, were you friends then?&rdquo; asked Allan Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that day made us friends,&rdquo; answered Colonel Anderson, &ldquo;and this was
      the way it happened. Everything was ready for the wedding. As many of the
      guests as it would hold were assembled in the drawing-room, the <span
      class="pagenum">057</span><a name="link057" id="link057"></a>room on the
      left of the front door there as you go in, but the clergyman had not
      arrived. Then it was that Mr. Custis, beginning to grow nervous, called to
      Joe there, who stood on the porch, as fine as silk in his best clothes and
      white cotton gloves, ready to open the carriage doors for the guests as
      they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; called Mr. Custis, &lsquo;run down the road, and see if you see a sign
      of a carriage anywhere in sight,&rsquo; and, children, what do you suppose Joe
      did? Well, he just stood stock still, looking down at his bright polished
      boots, and he never budged an inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s de truf,&rdquo; said Joe, shaking his head regretfully, for the children
      were looking to him for confirmation of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the boots were very shiny,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, in a tone of
      apology for Joe, &ldquo;and the roads were very very muddy, so that he just
      couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do it. Fortunately for Joe, I imagine, Mr.
      Custis had not waited to see him start, taking for granted, of course,
      that he would obey at once, and then what did I do but spring down the
      steps and run on Joe&rsquo;s errand for him, only too thankful if I could do
      anything to prove my gratitude for being allowed to be present at that, to
      me, greatest of occasions. I had to wait less than five minutes before I
      discovered the open <span class="pagenum">058</span><a name="link058"
       id="link058"></a>chaise, which had been sent into Washington to bring the
      dominie, tearing up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re coming, they&rsquo;ll be here in a minute,&rsquo; I called, hurrying back to
      Joe, and then he rushed away in his new shiny boots and delivered my
      message to Mr. Custis, pretending, as the rogue confessed to me afterward,
      to be quite out of breath from the haste with which he had come. And then
      in the next moment Mr. Meade, for that was the clergyman&rsquo;s name, was
      really there, but he came in at the back door and slipped upstairs as
      quickly as he could, followed by Joe and myself. You see he had driven
      right into the heart of a heavy thunder shower, just outside of
      Washington, and was drenched to the skin. There was nothing for it but
      that he must make a change of clothing as quickly as he could, so Joe, who
      knew where Mr. Custis kept his clothes, ran hither and thither, bringing
      one article after another, and I helped the minister into them&mdash;but
      my, how he did look! Mr. Custis was short and stout, and Mr. Meade was
      tall and thin, and I didn&rsquo;t see how any one could keep their faces
      straight with such a guy of a minister. They couldn&rsquo;t have done it either,
      if they had seen how he looked, could they, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Colonel, not for a minute,&rdquo; chuckled Joe. <span class="pagenum">059</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a>"But why didn&rsquo;t they see?&rdquo; questioned
      eager little Allan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because, of course, he had brought his gown with him, and it covered
      him all up,&rdquo; for Brevet, able to anticipate much of the familiar story,
      was glad to have a hand in its telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could know how the house looked in those days,&rdquo; said the
      Colonel with a sigh of regret, echoed by a much louder and deeper sigh on
      the part of Joe. &ldquo;It was full of the most beautiful things. There was a
      magnificent array of old family portraits; among them two or three of
      George and Martha Washington. Then there was a marvelous old sideboard
      that held many beautiful things that had belonged to Washington. I
      remember in particular some great silver candlesticks with snuffers and
      extinguishers, and silver wine-coolers, and some exquisite painted china,
      part of a set that had been given to Washington by the Society of the
      Cincinnati.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you have told the children,&rdquo; interrupted Grandma Ellis,
      &ldquo;who it was that Miss Custis married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can that be possible?&rdquo; provoked that he should have left out anything so
      important. &ldquo;Why, it was General Robert E. Lee!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">060</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a>"I&rsquo;m afraid we don&rsquo;t know who General Lee
      was,&rdquo; said Mary Bennett, blushing a little, and then she added quickly,
      &ldquo;you see we live so far away from where the war was fought,&rdquo; for Brevet&rsquo;s
      undisguised look of astonishment was really quite paralysing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only know what we have learnt at school,&rdquo; Teddy further explained,
      &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t remember so very much of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, General Lee,&rdquo; said Brevet earnestly, feeling that he must come
      personally to the rescue of such dense ignorance, &ldquo;was the greatest
      general they had down South. He would have whipped us Yankees if any one
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a fine man though, a fine man,&rdquo; said Joe, solemnly. &ldquo;He and Miss
      Mary lived right on here at Arlington after dey was married and dere
      wasn&rsquo;t a slave of us on de place who wouldn&rsquo;t hab let Lieutenant Lee walk
      right ober us if he&rsquo;d wanted to. So den when Mr. Custis died in 1857, and
      Lieutenant Lee done come to be de haid of de house, it was changin&rsquo; one
      good master for anoder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Joe a slave?&rdquo; asked Allan, drawing himself up to Mammy&rsquo;s knees, near
      whom he happened to be sitting, and speaking in an awe-struck whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Honey, Joe was born in a cabin <span class="pagenum">061</span><a
      name="link061" id="link061"></a>nex&rsquo; where he lives to-day, an&rsquo; we was all
      slaves down here &lsquo;fo&rsquo; de wah, but de coloured folks here at Arlington was
      always treated ver&rsquo; han&rsquo;some. I wasn&rsquo;t so fortunate, Honey&mdash;I
      belonged down to a plantation in Georgia, where de Missus was kind, but
      where our Master treated us des like cattle, an&rsquo; I had my only chile sold
      away from me, when she wasn&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo; den fo&rsquo;teen or fifteen, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;
      know ter this day whether she be livin&rsquo; or daid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mammy!&rdquo; was all Allan could say in reply, but his little face looked
      worlds of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Joe and Colonel Anderson between them went on with the story of
      Arlington, now one and now the other taking up its thread. Joe told of the
      many cosy cabins at that time dotted about the place in which the slaves
      lived, and of their happy life on a plantation where they all felt as
      though they were part of the household, and took as great pride and
      pleasure as the Master himself in everything belonging to it. He
      described, too, to the great delight of the children, the wild excitement
      of the Autumn hunting parties, when Mr. Custis and a whole houseful of
      guests would start off at sunrise, coming home at night with their
      game-bags full to a banquet in the house and an evening of unbounded fun
      and merri<span class="pagenum">062</span><a name="link062" id="link062"></a>ment.
      The Colonel told about the house itself, for from the time he became a
      young man until the day when, about to take command of a Washington
      regiment, he came to say goodbye to Lieutenant Lee, he had been a constant
      visitor there. He told of the luxury and comfort of the delightful home,
      now so bare and desolate; of the pretty sewing-rooms in the right wing,
      set apart for Mrs. Custis and Miss Mary; of the cosy library in the left
      wing, and then of the pictures painted on the walls by Mr. Custis. The
      pictures represented five of the battles of the Revolution, and Washington
      was the central figure in them all. There is just a trace of some of his
      work left now on the rear entrance of the wide hall, but Colonel Anderson
      admitted they could never have been considered very fine, rather
      detracting than adding to the other beautiful finishings of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what became of all the beautiful things and how did the place ever
      happen to become a national cemetery?&rdquo; asked Courage in one of the pauses,
      when both Joe and the Colonel seemed to be casting about in their minds
      for what would best be told next. She had listened as intently as any of
      the children to the whole narrative, and was every whit as much
      interested. <span class="pagenum">063</span><a name="link063" id="link063"></a>"Well,
      it seems to me that is almost a story in itself,&rdquo; Colonel Anderson
      answered, &ldquo;and that we would better have out the luncheon baskets and take
      a bit of rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the children agreed but half-heartedly at first to this interruption,
      but the avidity with which they afterward settled down to sandwiches and
      sponge cake showed that they really had minds not above the physical
      demands of life.

      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;ARLINGTON AFTERWARD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>iss Sylvy,&rdquo; asked
      Joe, rather solemnly, &ldquo;would you be so kin&rsquo; as ter tell me whar you hail
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean where I was born?&rdquo; Joe nodded. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I
      can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; and the colour surged perceptibly under her dark skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Joe, pressing his lower lip over the upper one, as he had a
      habit of doing when he considered any matter required careful thought.
      Then after a pause, &ldquo;Well, your las&rsquo; name, Miss Sylvy, will you tell me
      dat? I don&rsquo; rightly remember eber to have heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester, Joe, but it&rsquo;s a name I chose for myself. I do not know what
      name I was born to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, however, Miss Sylvy, did dat happen?&rdquo; and Joe showed such deep and
      tender interest that Sylvia, who cared to talk on the subject with very
      few, gladly entered into a full explanation. She told him, as she had
      <span class="pagenum">065</span><a name="link065" id="link065"></a>told
      Courage that summer night so many years before on Larry&rsquo;s lighter, how she
      had found herself landed in the orphan asylum, with no name as far as any
      one knew, excepting just Sylvia, and how she had named herself Sylvester
      after one of the ladies who came to the asylum to teach. And then she
      continued, giving a brief outline of her life since that time, all of
      which proved most absorbing to Joe, because with the telling of Sylvia&rsquo;s
      story he learnt so much of interest about Miss Courage as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Honey,&rdquo; he asked at the end of the story, with a sigh as of one who
      has listened with an intentness bordering upon fatigue, &ldquo;who put you in
      dat &rsquo;sylum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one just left me at the asylum at night, with a card pinned on to my
      dress with &lsquo;Sylvia&rsquo; written on it, and saying that I had neither father
      nor mother, and then ran away in the darkness, but I don&rsquo;t believe any one
      related to me would have treated me like that. I would rather you would
      not say anything about all this, Joe. It is only because you are one of my
      own people and seem so kind and interested that I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you bery much for de confidence, Miss Sylvy, for my ole heart went
      right out to you from de day you done come walkin&rsquo; up de <span
      class="pagenum">066</span><a name="link066" id="link066"></a>path at
      Little Homespun, but I&rsquo;ll keep it safe, Miss Sylvy, never you fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe and Sylvia had been busy washing dishes and clearing up after the
      luncheon, and it was when their work was finished and they were waiting
      under the chestnut tree for the others to come back, that they had had
      their little talk. It reached its natural conclusion just as Colonel
      Anderson came strolling up from the river, blowing a shrill whistle
      between two fingers, the signal previously agreed upon to call the
      children together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do you know,&rdquo; he said, when the little company had bestowed itself
      in much the same fashion as in the morning, &ldquo;I have an idea that you will
      have to let Joe and me do all the talking now. We have only a short
      afternoon before us, and there is a great deal to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one looked as though that would be the least hardship, and Joe
      explained that he himself would rather listen than talk, &ldquo;less&rsquo;n de.
      Colonel disremembered somethin&rsquo; very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely as not I shall, Joe, but it seems the point at which to commence
      this afternoon is with General Lee. At the time that he married Miss
      Mollie Custis he was a lieutenant in the United States Army, but he had
      gradu<span class="pagenum">067</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>ated
      at the head of his class at West Point only two years before. After he was
      married, as you know, he made his home at Arlington, but he had to be away
      from it much of the time because of his duties in the army. He was a fine
      fellow, I can tell you, and held one responsible position after another.
      He was right in the thick of our war with Mexico, and won rapid promotion
      for his courage and daring. After a brilliant charge at Chapultepec, when
      he was severely wounded, he was made a brevet-colonel by General Scott. It
      seemed after that as though he was everywhere where a brave, fearless man
      was needed. He was in command in Texas when the Indians were attacking the
      settlers there; and was in many a bloody engagement. Later on, he was the
      commanding officer when the house was charged at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, where
      John Brown had taken refuge. I wish there was time, children, to stop and
      tell you about John Brown. You know the old song about &lsquo;John Brown&rsquo;s body
      lies a mouldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching on.&rsquo; Get Joe
      here to sing it for you some day, if you don&rsquo;t. Well, you see by all this
      that General Lee had done a great deal for his country; but there came a
      day when he felt it his duty to turn against it, that is, to take up arms
      against the <span class="pagenum">068</span><a name="link068" id="link068"></a>United
      States. You all know how the great civil war finally came about; how the
      Northern States thought the Southern States should not hold slaves, and
      how the Southern States thought they had the right to decide whether they
      should or not without any interference from the North, and so banded
      themselves together and said they would secede from the United States and
      form a confederacy of their own. This Virginia, whose air we are breathing
      this minute, was one of those states, and was General Lee&rsquo;s native state
      as well; and when the time came to choose between his state and his
      country, he decided to side with the Confederacy. Then, of course, there
      was nothing for him to do but to resign from the United States Army. He
      sent his letter of resignation to General Scott on the twenty-second of
      April, 1861, and then at once left Arlington with his wife and children,
      for it was quite too near to Washington for him to stay now that he had
      taken a stand against the Government, and the very next day he was made
      commander-in-chief of the army in Virginia. A few days before this, that
      is, on the fifteenth of April, President Lincoln had called for
      seventy-five thousand volunteers, and three days after the Lees had left,
      the great army of the North came pouring into Washington and all the <span
      class="pagenum">069</span><a name="link069" id="link069"></a>country round
      about. Camp-fires crackled among the oaks at Arlington, and the house
      itself was taken possession of by the officers, When the troops first
      arrived at Arlington they tramped through the deserted rooms, remaining
      just as the Lees had left them, and concluding that &lsquo;all&rsquo;s fair in love
      and war,&rsquo; they simply helped themselves to the forsaken treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but dose were drefful days!&rdquo; said Joe, as though he must give vent to
      the thoughts Colonel Anderson&rsquo;s words had stirred: &ldquo;I neber can forgive
      dose Union soldiers, neber. Seems as dough dey might done have respect for
      a gentleman&rsquo;s place, but not a bit of it. Seemed as dough dey could not be
      spiteful &lsquo;nuff &rsquo;gainst de General. Des fancy seein&rsquo; things dat had
      belonged to Washington himself carried out of de house, and sol&rsquo; in de
      streets up dere in de city of Washington, and some of de negroes&mdash;shame
      on &rsquo;em!&mdash;ran away with things an&rsquo; sol&rsquo; &rsquo;em for more
      money dan dey themselves would have sol&rsquo; for &rsquo;fo&rsquo; de wah. Oh, it
      was pitiful to see the flower beds and lawns tramped over, as dough dey
      had been so much rubbish, and it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t long befo&rsquo; de smooth green
      terraces were just ragged mud-banks. You&rsquo;d have thought I&rsquo;d have gone
      away, wouldn&rsquo;t you? But I couldn&rsquo;t bring my<span class="pagenum">070</span><a
      name="link070" id="link070"></a>self to leave de ole place, until I &rsquo;listed
      an&rsquo; went down to Alabama wid a coloured regiment. Dere, Colonel, I done
      interrupt you, didn&rsquo;t I? But really, I was des thinkin&rsquo; aloud more dan
      talkin&rsquo;, for I des can&rsquo;t keep my thoughts to myself, when I grows &rsquo;stracted
      over de troublousness of dose times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, Joe, I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; said Colonel Anderson; &ldquo;but,
      as for me, I was feeling pretty hot against General Lee those days. I
      didn&rsquo;t see how he could make up his mind to regularly take up arms against
      his country, and I have an idea that I felt for awhile that he was treated
      no worse than he deserved; but that&rsquo;s all bygones now, as well as the dear
      old Arlington home, that will never be a home again. You see, almost at
      the commencement of the war, children, Washington, with all the country
      immediately about, became the hospital centre, and soon a surgeon&rsquo;s staff
      was quartered in the house yonder, in addition to the officers already
      there; and at the same time long canvas shelters were constructed in those
      woods, to which the poor sick and wounded soldiers were brought from camp
      and battlefield&mdash;and sadly enough many of them died here. At first
      all who died were taken to the Soldiers&rsquo; Home Cemetery on the other side
      of Washington to be <span class="pagenum">071</span><a name="link071"
       id="link071"></a>buried, but the day came, as you know, when this very
      place was turned into a cemetery, and this was how it came about. One
      afternoon as President Lincoln was starting for his usual drive, which
      seemed to be the only way by which he could gain any relief from the
      burdens of that anxious time, he met General Meigs (who was Quarter-master
      General then of the United States Army) walking in the White House
      grounds. Noticing how tired and worn out the General looked, the President
      invited him to drive with him, and General Meigs accepted. It was the
      President&rsquo;s purpose to drive out to Arlington, and when they reached
      there, the President started off for a quiet stroll; but General Meigs,
      whose thoughts were very busy just then as to what should be done with the
      poor soldiers, dying in such numbers in and about Washington, was soon
      deep in conference with the surgeons in charge. You see there would soon
      have been no more room in other cemeteries, and it was for the
      Quarter-master General to decide what was to be done in the matter. Now
      they say that General Meigs indulged in very bitter feelings toward his
      old friend General Lee, and that when he rejoined the President he said,
      &lsquo;Lee shall never return to Arlington, no matter what the issue of the war
      may be,&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">072</span><a name="link072" id="link072"></a>feeling
      evidently that he should be fully punished in any case for the stand he
      had taken. Just at that moment a sad little procession came that way. The
      bodies of several poor fellows, who had died in the hospital tents, were
      being carried on canvas stretchers to a spot from whence they could be
      taken to the Soldiers&rsquo; Home Cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How many men are awaiting burial?&rsquo; asked General Meigs of the Sergeant
      in charge of the squad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Altogether a dozen, sir,&rsquo; the Sergeant answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bury them there,&rsquo; ordered the General, pointing to a low terrace
      bordering the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did General Meigs have any right to turn General Lee&rsquo;s place into a
      cemetery?&rdquo; asked Courage, a little warmly, feeling that an interruption
      was excusable under the circumstances. To be fair always, if possible, to
      everybody, was a working principle with Courage, and this proceeding of
      General Meigs&rsquo;s did not seem to her quite fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he had a perfect right, Miss Courage. In time of war the
      Government certainly has a right to take possession, if necessary, of
      property belonging to any one in open rebellion against it; and besides,
      five <span class="pagenum">073</span><a name="link073" id="link073"></a>months
      before Arlington was converted into a cemetery, the place had been put up
      at public sale and bought by the Government. It was not, I believe, until
      1873, however, that the Lees received any money for the estate, and that I
      admit does not seem fair at all. And there is another right of which I am
      certain, and that is that the brave fellows whose bodies rest in these
      graves had a right to the most beautiful spot anywhere in these United
      States of ours for their last resting-place. No, I think it was fitting
      that Arlington should become one of our national cemeteries, and I believe
      even Joe yonder, thinks so too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do, Colonel Anderson,&rdquo; Joe answered, solemnly. &ldquo;Much as I love
      General Lee, I can&rsquo;t forget what de war cos&rsquo; de country in de loss of
      human life, and General Lee done took a great &rsquo;sponsibility &rsquo;pon
      him, when he help de war on by takin&rsquo; command of de Southern troops. Yes,
      I&rsquo;m glad dat de fine ole place has been pressed into de service of de
      country, in des de way it has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Anderson&rsquo;s question put to Joe and Joe&rsquo;s reply seemed to loosen
      the tongues of the little company. Almost every one from Brevet up had
      some question or other to ask of the Colonel, and he was quite willing
      that they should, for they had all listened so atten<span class="pagenum">074</span><a
      name="link074" id="link074"></a>tively that the story had been told more
      quickly than either Joe or the Colonel had thought possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, children,&rdquo; said Brevet, with the air of a little grandfather,
      &ldquo;do you wonder that I love to come and spend the day with Joe? Why, there
      isn&rsquo;t a minute when I&rsquo;m here, that he isn&rsquo;t telling me something &lsquo;bout
      before the war, or since the war, and when we go back to the cabin and Joe
      makes the hoe-cake and broils a chicken for luncheon, and I get the china
      down from the cupboard and set the table, with both of us talking most
      interesting all the time, and the smell of the cooking just filling all
      the cabin,&mdash;well, there isn&rsquo;t ever such a happy time, is there, Joe?&rdquo;
       Brevet had made his way to Joe&rsquo;s side as he spoke, and reaching up, put
      one chubby little arm around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, bless yo&rsquo; little white heart, dere never is quite such a happy time!&rdquo;
       and Joe drew the little fellow into his lap and held him close, as though
      he would love to keep him there forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is being in the cabin and having Joe cook the hoe-cake and the chicken
      nicer than having luncheon out here in the grass like this?&rdquo; asked Allan
      Bennett, a whole world of envy in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">075</span><a name="link075" id="link075"></a>"A heap
      nicer,&rdquo; was Brevet&rsquo;s not uncertain reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really t&rsquo;ink so, Honey?&rdquo; asked Joe, smiling from ear to ear.
      &ldquo;Well, den, all you little Bennetts is invited on de spot, to take Fo&rsquo;th
      of July dinner wid me in my cabin, an&rsquo; if Miss Courage will honour me wid
      her presence, an&rsquo; de Colonel will come out from Washington, an&rsquo; Miss Sylvy
      will lend me a hand wid de preparations, strikes me we might hab a good
      time sure nuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody accepted Joe&rsquo;s invitation with alacrity, and there could not
      have been a happier ending to a perfect day than to have just such another
      perfect day planned for at its close. It simply took all the bitterness
      out of the parting that followed soon after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lindy,&rdquo; whispered Joe importantly, as he helped Grandma Ellis into
      the carriage, &ldquo;I &rsquo;spects you and Mars Harry for de Fo&rsquo;th of July
      dinner, but as dere won&rsquo;t be no room for Mammy I didn&rsquo;t make no public
      mention of your two names. Seemed as dough it might make her feel a bit
      uncomfortable if she was de only one not mentioned; but you understan&rsquo;,
      Miss Lindy, de cabin am small an&rsquo; Mammy large, an&rsquo;&rdquo; (putting his hand to
      his mouth and speaking in a still lower whisper) &ldquo;seems like Mammy gettin&rsquo;
      <span class="pagenum">076</span><a name="link076" id="link076"></a>too old
      to be of much use to anybody. You un&rsquo;erstan&rsquo;, Miss Lindy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I understand perfectly,&rdquo; Grandma Ellis answered, very much
      amused, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make it all right with Mammy.&rdquo; But from Grandma Ellis&rsquo;s
      point of view Mammy did not seem to be growing old one whit more rapidly
      than old Joe himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;TO SAVE BREVET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etween one happy
      time and another the summer passed on at Little Homespun. Not that there
      was not occasionally an unhappy time&mdash;if everything had moved
      perfectly smoothly for three whole months together, in a house where there
      were four irrepressible children, with many of the faults common to the
      average child the world over, it simply would have been a miracle
      outright. No, indeed; there were times now and then when Courage quite
      lost her patience and would have liked to box and ship those four little
      Bennetts straight back to their mother, and there were days when even
      good-natured Mary Duff lost her patience completely, and declared she
      would chastise the first one of them that dared to cross the threshold of
      the kitchen; but then, to be quite fair, I have more than a glimmering
      notion that Courage and Mary Duff had their naughty moods too, as well as
      the children. You can&rsquo;t feel perfectly right, you know, and always behave
      just as <span class="pagenum">078</span><a name="link078" id="link078"></a>you
      should every minute simply because you happen to be grown up. It would be
      very fine if you could, and there is no doubt that with both grown-ups and
      children, trying hard to get the best of the naughty moods will in time
      accomplish wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But taken as a whole the unhappy times at Homespun were nothing more than
      motes in the Homespun sunshine. Most of the time merry, happy voices rang
      through and about the house from dawn till sunset. Peals of happy
      laughter, that made any one laugh who heard them, echoed everywhere. Bits
      of childish song floated down stairs and up stairs or came in at the open
      windows&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;se a little Alabama Coon&rdquo; always the burden of the
      refrain when Brevet was down for the day. Then, toward twilight, or more
      often a little later, when it had really grown quite dark, the same dear
      childish voices blended in a sweet evening hymn would float out at the
      open windows, and the little people whose whole minds had been given to
      play the long summer day through, would quiet down and then go contentedly
      off to bed, their childish hearts full of a sweet peace that they hardly
      understood, and which was not strange at all, for it was simply the peace
      that &ldquo;passeth all understanding.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">079</span><a
      name="link079" id="link079"></a>But not all the days by any manner of
      means were spent in or about Little Homespun. Joe&rsquo;s Fourth of July dinner
      had been a great success, and there had followed several all-day
      excursions carefully planned in all their details by Uncle Harry, and
      every one of them voted a great success. The fall that had broken Uncle
      Harry&rsquo;s arm had proved a veritable &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; for the children, if a
      windfall means something very pleasant that comes in your way quite by
      accident, like apples strewn by the wind unexpectedly at your feet. It had
      not been altogether an unpleasant experience for Uncle Harry either,
      notwithstanding, though it was now late in August, the arm was still in a
      sling. Twice it had had to be reset, and that had of course been very
      trying; and yet but for that arm he would have been delving away the whole
      summer through in a hot office up at Washington, and the children, without
      knowing of course what they were missing, would in fact have foregone half
      the delight of the summer. In Uncle Harry&rsquo;s profession, no right arm to
      use meant nothing to do whatever, and so he was thankful enough that
      Courage and the Bennetts had found their way down to old Virginia, and
      that he had been able to plan and carry out so many delightful excursions
      <span class="pagenum">080</span><a name="link080" id="link080"></a>for
      their enjoyment. But the summer&rsquo;s crown of pleasure, as far as the
      Bennetts were concerned, had been the days spent at Ellismere with Brevet
      on his island.
    </p>
    <p>
      I half believe I have not mentioned this island before, for which omission
      I am perfectly confident Brevet would never forgive me. The idea of trying
      to write anything whatever about him and not tell about that island the
      very first thing! It was altogether a wonderful place, I assure you. It
      lay about a hundred feet out from the shore, just in front of the
      Ellismere homestead; and as there was not another island within sight of
      it, Brevet always gratefully cherished the belief that it had been placed
      there just for him. It was about seventy feet long, and almost as wide,
      and it boasted a steep little ledge of rock on the side near the shore and
      two very respectable little pine trees. But it was what the hand of man
      had achieved upon this little island that made it the wonderful place it
      was, and that hand none other than old black Joe&rsquo;s. It was he who had said
      one sunshiny May morning: &ldquo;Brevet, I&rsquo;ll build a camp for you over on that
      island,&rdquo; and true to his word Joe had driven up to Ellismere every day
      that summer that he could spare from his not very arduous duties at
      Arlington, and he had worked <span class="pagenum">081</span><a
      name="link081" id="link081"></a>away as zealously as though he had assumed
      the work under contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result it had been finished the October previous, and Brevet had had
      several weeks to enjoy it before the cold weather obliged him to break
      camp for the winter. Grandma Ellis&rsquo;s contribution to the scheme had been a
      cedar row-boat and a pair of spoon oars, by which to have communication
      with the island, but for everything else Joe was to be thanked. He had cut
      and sewed the tent, to say nothing of a canvas cot. He had manufactured
      tables and chairs, and best of all a soldier&rsquo;s chest, with
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h5>
      HOWARD STANHOPE ELLIS
    </h5>
    <h5>
      BREVET-CAPTAIN
    </h5>
    <p>
      burned in clear-cut letters upon the lid. There was even a little desk of
      rude contrivance upon which Brevet, after the successful conclusion of
      most exciting battles, would write cheering letters home to his
      grandmother. Outside of the tent hung a good-sized kettle over a bed of
      ashes, that bore witness to many a good meal cooked within it, while on
      the rocky ledge above, a toy brass cannon commanded the harbour, making
      the island quite invulnerable from any assault that might be attempted
      from the side near the shore. <span class="pagenum">082</span><a
      name="link082" id="link082"></a>Was it strange then that to the Bennetts,
      and especially to the boys Teddy and Allan, this unique little spot, with
      its perfect equipment, offered more possibilities of good times than
      anything they themselves could in any way concoct or invent?&mdash;and
      they had lived up to their possibilities, though that had involved living
      at Ellismere most of the time. However, Grandma Ellis assured Courage they
      were not a bit of trouble, and Courage took her at her word, for the sake
      of what it meant to the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of all the wildly-exciting and happy days, none had seemed quite so
      exciting and happy as the day to which we have now come in this story.
      Perhaps the fact that there could not by any chance be many more of these
      times, lent its own specially brightening charm to the blessings that must
      soon take their flight; for it was the 27th of August by the calendar, and
      by the middle of September Little Homespun would be closed, and Courage
      and the Bennetts have taken their departure. Joe had been with the
      children all day, and he was the one to be thanked for most of its wildly
      exciting features. Single-handed, but supposed to represent a whole
      regiment, he had tried in a score of ways to effect a landing on the
      island; but by dint of unceasing vigi<span class="pagenum">083</span><a
      name="link083" id="link083"></a>lance the children had succeeded in
      keeping him at bay, until at last, despairing and exhausted, he had beaten
      a retreat to the main land. Indeed, so hard and unremitting had been the
      labours of the children, that about the middle of the afternoon Courage,
      who had been having an all-day chat with Grandma Ellis and was afraid the
      children would quite wear themselves out, succeeded in coaxing them to the
      shore, under promise of a story, and it was not to be any ordinary,
      made-up story either. Naturally in her daily contact with the children,
      Courage had alluded now and then to her own childhood, and with the result
      that they had extracted from her the pledge that she would tell them all
      about it some day. But as yet Courage&rsquo;s &ldquo;some day&rdquo; never had dawned,
      although they had repeatedly begged for the story&mdash;now they concluded
      the time had come to take a stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell us the story about yourself if we come over?&rdquo; Teddy called
      from the island. &ldquo;We are all agreed we cannot think of laying down our
      arms unless you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Courage called back, glad to commit them to an hour of quiet at
      any cost; and so the children embarked and rowed over, and Grandma
      entreated so hard that she might be allowed to listen too, that Courage
      <span class="pagenum">084</span><a name="link084" id="link084"></a>yielded,
      and the little group gathered itself about her big rocking-chair on the
      gallery. Joe was also permitted to form one of the party; but there was
      another listener, who would not have been tolerated for a moment if his
      whereabouts had been known. He was stretched full length on the hair-cloth
      sofa just between the windows in the living-room, and, knowing it would be
      quite impossible for him to gain permission to be a hearer, he was just
      sufficiently unprincipled to listen without so much as saying &ldquo;by your
      leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You know the story that Courage told&mdash;if not you may read it if you
      have a mind, in the little book to which this is a sequel. At the outset,
      of course, she told how she had come by her unusual name, which was the
      greatest relief to Joe and Brevet. They had wanted so much to have that
      explained the whole summer through and yet had not quite liked to ask. The
      remainder of the story was new to all save Grandma Ellis, and Courage, now
      that she had really started, tried to be faithful to every detail that
      could possibly have any interest, from the day of her christening to the
      night when the draw was open and she took her wild leap in the darkness.
      When she had finished every one sat perfectly still for a minute. Courage
      told her own story much better <span class="pagenum">085</span><a
      name="link085" id="link085"></a>than any one else has told or could tell
      it, and her great absorbing love for Miss Julia shone out like a golden
      thread all through the telling. Grandma Ellis was the first to draw a long
      breath and break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I wish I might have known your Miss Julia,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know somebody who is just exactly like her,&rdquo; said Mary Bennett,
      putting her arm about Courage; &ldquo;<i>just exactly!</i>&rdquo; and this she said
      very slowly and firmly, as though she thought Courage might be inclined to
      differ with her, but Courage only said, &ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; in a low whisper, so
      grateful was she for the most blessed praise that could possibly come to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see Miss Julia&rsquo;s picture now, please,&rdquo; urged the children, and
      Courage drew from her dress an exquisite miniature, set in pearls, and
      attached to a violet ribbon worn about her neck. They had all seen it many
      a time before, but it seemed to take on a new beauty in the light of all
      they had been hearing. It was when the picture had been passed slowly from
      hand to hand, and the natural thing seemed to be for the little party to
      break up, that Allan was the first to discover that one of the party had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is Brevet?&rdquo; he exclaimed, as <span class="pagenum">086</span><a
      name="link086" id="link086"></a>though part of his personal belongings had
      given him the slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure &lsquo;nuff, where is dat chile?&rdquo; queried Joe, getting up from his
      chair a little stiffly and peering up to the gallery roof and to the
      branches of the trees, as though the most unlikely spot imaginable was
      precisely the spot in which to expect to find his little Captain. &ldquo;Seems
      to me it looks a little ugly over there toward Fort Meyer,&rdquo; he added,
      stepping to the end of the porch and shading his eyes with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Harry, who had been thinking over all he had heard, rose
      noiselessly from the lounge and slipped away to the rear of the house.
      There he saw at a glance that it did indeed look more than &ldquo;a little ugly&rdquo;
       over toward Fort Meyer. A large, funnel-shaped cloud of a dark brown color
      loomed high on the horizon and Harry&rsquo;s heart sank within him. He had seen
      and known during a summer&rsquo;s surveying in the West, the wreck and ruin that
      may follow in the train of such a cloud, and he knew that everything
      should be gotten into shape as quickly as possible. Hurrying quickly to
      the front porch he said, with as much composure as he could muster:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would better go directly into the house, Grandma, we may be going to
      have <span class="pagenum">087</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a>quite
      a storm. Send the children through all the rooms and have every shutter
      drawn to, and every window closed and fastened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Brevet,&rdquo; said Grandma, trying her best to keep her voice steady, &ldquo;no
      one knows where Brevet is. No one saw him go, or has any idea where he
      went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he can&rsquo;t be far away,&rdquo; Harry answered, cheerily. &ldquo;Joe and I will find
      him in a jiffy. Now you do as I say, Grandma,&rdquo; gently pushing her toward
      the door, &ldquo;and, children, whisk these chairs into the house, and then make
      for the doors and windows and close them tightly. Don&rsquo;t stop to look, or
      lose a single minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry succeeded in speaking calmly, but his manner showed how urgent he
      deemed the need of haste, and try as she would Grandma found herself
      unequal to the occasion. Her limbs refused to support her, and once inside
      the house she sank into the nearest chair, and, burying her face in her
      hands, broke into an agony of sobs and tears. To have little Brevet
      missing at such an anxious moment was more than her over-strained nerves
      could bear. Courage saw instantly it was for her to take command of the
      situation, and sending the children hither and thither through the house
      as Harry had directed, she herself hurried <span class="pagenum">088</span><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a>away for the stimulant of which Grandma
      Ellis so sorely stood in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile poor old Joe, who in his alarm for Brevet&rsquo;s safety had lost his
      head completely, had been wasting precious moments in looking in the most
      impossible places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mars Harry, whar can dat blessed child be?&rdquo; he said, coming up to
      Harry with the tears streaming down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you looked over on the island, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I never thought of dat, Mars Harry,&rdquo; but the misery that was in Joe&rsquo;s
      voice showed that he took in instantly all the dreadful possibilities, if
      the storm should break with Brevet alone on the island. They hurried as
      fast as they could to the shore, and there, sure enough! was Brevet, hard
      at work, getting his little camp into shape for the coming storm he had
      evidently been the first to discover. At that precise moment he was busy
      hauling down the little camp flag, but that he was not in the least
      disconcerted was perfectly evident. In the awful ominous hush preceding
      the storm, they could even catch the familiar strain of &ldquo;I&rsquo;se a little
      Alabama Coon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not frighten him, Joe,&rdquo; Harry said, his breath coming short and
      fast, &ldquo;we must just call to him to come right back. <span class="pagenum">089</span><a
      name="link089" id="link089"></a>But where is the boat, Joe? <i>Where</i>
      is the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mars Harry! Mars Harry! look dere,&rdquo; and now the fear in Joe&rsquo;s voice
      had turned to veriest anguish; and Harry looking, saw the precious boat in
      mid-river, the oars still resting in the oar-locks, but as hopelessly
      beyond reach as though in mid-ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo; cried Harry, looking down at the helpless arm bound firmly in
      the splints. Then, crying, &ldquo;I will get a man from the stables; stay right
      where you are, Joe,&rdquo; he was gone in a flash. A man from the stables! Joe
      knew how long that must take. No, there was just one thing to be done, and
      stripping off boots and jacket, in the next second he was breast deep in
      the water, and in the next striking out bravely for the island. It was a
      hard tug for the old man, for the current was strong; but Brevet, still
      unmindful of his danger, sang away with a will, and the words came
      distinctly over the water,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;se a little Alabama Coon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I hasn&rsquo;t been born very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, no you hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; muttered Joe, keeping his head well
      above water. &ldquo;You hasn&rsquo;t been born long &lsquo;nuff ter go out dis worl&rsquo; yet
      awhile, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and nerved by <span class="pagenum">090</span><a
      name="link090" id="link090"></a>the little fellow&rsquo;s unconscious calmness,
      Joe put all his strength in four or five more good strokes, and reached
      the camp, but he had no breath left with which to speak when he reached
      it. It was dreadful to waste the precious moments, but his breath was
      still too laboured from the strenuous effort he had been making for him to
      voice a single Word. Just at that moment Brevet turned to hurry down from
      the camp, and then stood riveted to the spot, his face white with terror.
      He did not see Joe in the dismay of his discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my boat is gone!&rdquo; he cried, lifting his two little clenched hands in
      helpless consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0121.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s your Cap&rsquo;ll,&rdquo; rang out a dear familiar voice, and Joe thanked
      God that he was able to instantly dispel the little fellow&rsquo;s fears. One
      bound, and Brevet was at Joe&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you swim over for me, Captain?&rdquo; his two arms locked about Joe&rsquo;s neck
      in his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I done swim ober for you Honey, an&rsquo; now we done goin&rsquo; ter swim back
      again. Des get on my ole back, dis a-way, Honey, only have a care not ter
      choke me an&rsquo; don&rsquo; be a-feared for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly necessary for Joe to have added that, for on Joe&rsquo;s back
      Brevet felt as <span class="pagenum">091</span><a name="link091"
       id="link091"></a>safe as any of the rest of us on the deck of an ocean
      steamer. Besides, it was such fun to be carried ashore in that fashion.
      Only once it seemed to cross his little mind that it might perhaps be
      rather hard work for Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m too heavy, I think I could swim all right. Shall I leave go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; gasped Joe, fearing the dauntless little fellow might put his
      suggestion immediately into practice, &ldquo;for Heben&rsquo;s sake, no, Brevet!&rdquo; and
      then Brevet tightened his hold as though realising there might be some
      danger. How great the danger only Joe himself knew, and he feared more
      than once that he would have to give up&mdash;that he could not save
      Brevet after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s search for help had been futile, and, rushing back to the shore,
      what was his joy to discover that Joe had dared to disobey orders and had
      safely crossed to the island! But what a terrible risk the old man was
      running, and, oh, the chagrin, young man that he was, of not being able
      himself to attempt the rescue! With bated breath he watched Joe&rsquo;s start
      for the mainland, and then saw instantly how even the first return strokes
      taxed his strength to the full. At the point for which he was making the
      far-spreading limbs of two old live-oaks extended out over the river, and
      Harry, plung<span class="pagenum">092</span><a name="link092" id="link092"></a>ing
      into the water and clinging by his good arm to the heavier of two parallel
      branches, was able to make his way to its extreme end, quite a distance
      from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steer right for me, Joe,&rdquo; he called, in a voice of earnest entreaty. &ldquo;See
      where I am, Joe, I can help you from here.&rdquo; But a sudden blackness had
      come before Joe&rsquo;s eyes, and he could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0129.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Meantime Courage had hurried from the house the first moment she could be
      spared; had reached the river&rsquo;s edge and instantly took in the situation.
      It would be little enough Harry could do even if poor Joe succeeded in
      reaching him&mdash;it was for her to gain some point as near him as
      possible, and be ready to lend a hand as well. Throwing aside a cloak she
      had caught up for protection, she strode into the water, and by aid of the
      same strong limb to which Harry was clinging, was able to take her place
      close behind him. Meantime not for one instant did Harry intermit his
      calls of encouragement, until at last the overhanging branch was almost
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he then called, in a voice of commanding entreaty, &ldquo;one stroke
      more! Now lay hold of me and you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; Joe had hardly consciousness
      enough left to obey, but he made one stroke more, and then his arms <span
      class="pagenum">093</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a>grasped
      something, he hardly knew what, with an iron grip, and barely keeping his
      head above water, his body dragged helplessly down the river with the
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall I do?&rdquo; gasped Brevet quickly, for he had at last fully
      realised the struggle of the crossing and knew that Joe&rsquo;s strength was all
      but gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lay hold of my arm, Brevet,&rdquo; cried Courage; &ldquo;now let go of Joe; now
      cling to me and pull yourself up here on this limb. Quick, quick, Brevet,
      don&rsquo;t lose a moment&mdash;there&mdash;now lie flat down and keep perfectly
      still with your arms firm around the branch under you. Now what?&rdquo; in a
      voice of bewildered appeal to Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you shift yourself to that other limb and bend it within Joe&rsquo;s reach?
      I am helpless.&rdquo; Harry spoke through teeth clenched with the effort of
      supporting Joe and his own dead weight by that one arm&rsquo;s hold on the
      branch beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an easy thing that Harry asked, but retreating toward the shore
      a little way, to a point where the branches came more closely together,
      she safely swung to the other limb, but in making her way out into the
      water again, she felt the ground fall gradually away beneath her feet,
      <span class="pagenum">094</span><a name="link094" id="link094"></a>"Careful,
      careful,&rdquo; called Harry; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get beyond your depth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all right,&rdquo; Courage answered calmly, though she knew for a certainty
      that she was already beyond her depth&mdash;but what did that matter in
      the imperative need of the moment? All this while Joe, with closed eyes,
      still realised that the one thing for him to do was to hold on.
      Notwithstanding the deeper water Courage succeeded in working out along
      the branch until near enough to Joe to bend it by her weight within his
      reach. Then she cried peremptorily, with what little breath was left her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, open your eyes.&rdquo; Joe mechanically obeyed. &ldquo;Now see this branch, Joe;
      reach for it and get upon your feet. The water is not deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry felt Joe&rsquo;s grasp relaxing from his body, but at the same time it was
      apparent that he was too weak and dazed to fully take in the situation,
      and was not about to make the effort necessary to seize the overhanging
      limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brevet,&rdquo; cried Harry, under his breath, &ldquo;speak to Joe. He is not going to
      try to save himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe! Joe!&rdquo; called Brevet, an agony of appeal in his voice. Joe&rsquo;s eyes
      opened again. <span class="pagenum">095</span><a name="link095"
       id="link095"></a>"Reach for that branch, Joe, and try to get ashore. I
      want you, Joe, I want you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet&rsquo;s dearly loved voice, with its deep sob of entreaty, seemed to
      reach some inner consciousness of Joe&rsquo;s. If Brevet needed him, he must
      make one last effort; and, letting go his relaxed hold of Harry, he
      reached for the branch; struggled to his feet, stumbling heavily against
      Courage; took the necessary steps to reach the shore, and then fell
      utterly unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the storm had broken in all its fury. A great yellow whirl of
      dust and sand came sweeping down upon them, carrying broken twigs and
      larger branches, in a twinkling, past them; then came the rain in
      torrents, and vivid flashes of lightning. Brevet clung terrified to the
      limb, but, manly little fellow that he was, made no outcry. Harry, with
      but one arm at his service, hung where he was; the water serving to buoy
      his body up, and to sustain his weight, but he was powerless to alter his
      position. Courage, by the aid of the limb, made her way to the shore. Then
      calling back to Harry, &ldquo;I will bring help at once,&rdquo; she dropped on to her
      hands and knees, for it was impossible to stand against the wind and rain,
      and began creeping up the embankment. But fortunately for them all, help
      was <span class="pagenum">096</span><a name="link096" id="link096"></a>at
      hand. Teddy Bennett, fairly blown along by the wind, appeared on the ledge
      above her. Courage, leaning heavily upon one hand, pointed down the river,
      and Teddy in another minute was in the water and close at Harry&rsquo;s side. It
      was the work of but a moment, strong young swimmer that he proved himself,
      to help Harry ashore, and then throwing themselves flat upon the ground
      and calling out every minute to Brevet to &ldquo;Hold on and keep a brave
      heart!&rdquo; they waited for the terrible storm to pass over.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;JOE HAS AN&rsquo; IDEA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was two weeks
      now since that dreadful afternoon up at Ellismere, and it has been a quiet
      two weeks for all of our little party. No one has had the heart for very
      much fun, for Grandma Ellis has been very ill up at Ellismere, and dear
      old Joe is lying helpless in bed in his own little cabin. After the storm
      had spent its force they had carried Joe up to the house, and there he had
      lain unmindful of everything about him for three whole days together.
      Then, when at last consciousness came back, power to move either right arm
      or leg did not come with it, and then they learned that poor old Joe was
      paralysed. As soon as possible after that they moved Joe up to Arlington,
      for he longed for his own bed and his own familiar cabin. And who do you
      suppose went up to care for Joe, but Mammy! &ldquo;If you can spare me. Miss
      Lindy,&rdquo; Mammy had said to Grandma Ellis, &ldquo;I would like to look out for Joe
      de res&rsquo; of his days. I ain&rsquo;t allers been ober kin&rsquo; to dat ole gem&rsquo;an, an&rsquo;
      I ain&rsquo;t had no idea what splendid stuff he had in <span class="pagenum">098</span><a
      name="link098" id="link098"></a>him,&rdquo; and it seemed a very little thing to
      Grandma Ellis to spare Mammy for the sake of the one who had saved
      Brevet&rsquo;s life. That Joe had saved it there was but little question, for
      the storm had seemed to be at its very height when it reached the island,
      levelling and demolishing everything upon it. The tent had been carried
      off bodily, no one knew where, and the little pine trees uprooted lay
      wedged in the rocks as though pounded in with an anvil, so that it seemed
      impossible that Brevet could have escaped being hurled into the river, or
      dashed against the rocks with the same terrible force as the pine trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had been unable to bring any one from the stables, for both the men,
      as it happened, were three miles away at the blacksmith&rsquo;s, and but for
      Joe&rsquo;s instant action, any help would have come too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      I doubt if Teddy will ever quite forgive Grandma Ellis, or his sister
      Mary, for forbidding him to join the party in search of Brevet, or ever
      cease to be thankful that at last, rushing out of the house in spite of
      all their protests, he was able to render such timely aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Joe, he accepted his utter helplessness with a beautiful
      resignation, but there was something on Joe&rsquo;s mind, and one day he said to
      Mammy: <span class="pagenum">099</span><a name="link099" id="link099"></a>"Would
      you min&rsquo;, Mammy, just sendin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; Miss Courage to come heah for awhile dis
      ebenin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;se somethin&rsquo; important ter say ter lier, &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t dat I couldn&rsquo;t
      trus&rsquo; you wid it, Mammy, only you knows dey am times when a &lsquo;spectable
      cullud pusson seem ter need der advice of a pusson what is born ter a
      different colour and station.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Courage shall be sent for dis bery ebenin&rsquo;, Joe,&rdquo; for Mammy had made
      up her mind that Joe was to be humoured in every particular. And so
      Courage came, and with Brevet, who had happened to be spending the day at
      Homespun, for her companion. They stopped to leave the buckboard at the
      stable, where a young mulatto boy was now doing Joe&rsquo;s work, and then
      Brevet asked permission to run on ahead. He had something on his mind, as
      well as Joe, and he was longing to ask him a question that had just
      occurred to him the day before, and which had made his little heart very
      heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he said in an awed whisper, stepping into the cabin and looking
      quickly about to see if Mammy happened to be out of hearing, &ldquo;are you
      asleep, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, bless your little heart,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s old face lighted up with the joy
      of Brevet&rsquo;s coming, &ldquo;I was des habin a bit o&rsquo; a day-dream.&rdquo; <span
      class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>"Joe,&rdquo;
       whispered Brevet, tip-toeing close to his side, &ldquo;I want you to tell me
      something. You&rsquo;re paralysed, you know, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Honey, I knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t because you went in the river for me, was it, Joe? It
      just happened to come then, didn&rsquo;t it, Joe?&rdquo; in anxious inquiry, and as
      though to find out that he was responsible for Joe&rsquo;s illness would be more
      than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Des happen? o&rsquo; course, chile, des happen. Why, des look at me, Honey!
      I&rsquo;se pow&rsquo;ful ole; reckon nobody knows how ole I be,&rdquo; (which was the truth,
      for Joe, if he knew himself, had never told any one), &ldquo;whereas mos&rsquo;
      white-haired cullud pussons is par&rsquo;Iysed long afore my time o&rsquo; life,
      par&rsquo;Iysed all over too, not des a sort o&rsquo; half par&rsquo;Iysed like me. No,
      neber you b&rsquo;lieve it anythin&rsquo; but des happened, no matter what folks say,
      case you &lsquo;member Joe tol&rsquo; you so, an&rsquo; I ought ter know, I reckon, better&rsquo;n
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as though a great shadow had been lifted from Brevet. Courage,
      wondering how to account for the little fellow&rsquo;s apparent spiritlessness
      all day, wondered now, as she entered, at the little illumined face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Brevet,&rdquo; said Joe, smiling a welcome to Courage, &ldquo;will you look
      ober de <span class="pagenum">101</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a>place
      while I&rsquo;se talkin&rsquo; ter Miss Courage. Go up to de house and down &lsquo;roun&rsquo;
      General Sheridan&rsquo;s grave, an&rsquo; my Oder special fav&rsquo;rites, an&rsquo; see if
      eberythin&rsquo; is bein&rsquo; kept up ter de handle, case no one knows as well as
      you, Brevet, how Joe allers like ter hab &lsquo;em kep&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet joyously obeyed, proud to be sent on such an important errand; and
      after Courage and Joe had exchanged a few words of greeting, Joe at once
      settled to the particular business in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Courage,&rdquo; he said, very solemnly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve dey&rsquo;s such anoder
      mean contemptible good for nothin&rsquo; darkey in all dis county as I is. Look
      at dis cabin! des as orderly as can be, an&rsquo; den &lsquo;member how I&rsquo;se allers
      treated Mammy. She ain&rsquo;t nowhere roun&rsquo;, is she?&rdquo; raising himself on one
      arm and looking cautiously about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mammy is way up the hill yonder, knitting under the chestnut tree. I
      met her as I came, and she told me that you had something important to say
      to me, and that she wouldn&rsquo;t come back until I called her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beats me,&rdquo; answered Joe, &ldquo;ter see Mammy so considerate an&rsquo; behavin&rsquo;
      hersel&rsquo; in dis fashion. Why, dere ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; Mammy can think of to make
      me mo&rsquo; comfortable dat she doesn&rsquo;t up an&rsquo; do in a jiffy. Why, when yo&rsquo;
      <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>Sylvy
      comes down ebry day or so, ter see if she can len&rsquo; a hand as you are so
      good as ter sen&rsquo; her, dey ain&rsquo;t, as a rule, nuffin lef for her ter do,
      &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Mammy set her ter make some little relish for me to pay her fo&rsquo;
      de trouble of cornin&rsquo;. Now can you &lsquo;magine, Miss Courage, how all dis mak&rsquo;
      me feel, case I&rsquo;se allers been down on Mammy? You &lsquo;member I neber so much
      as invite her ter my Fo&rsquo;th July dinner. I allers &lsquo;spect Grandma Ellis
      staid away so as to let Mammy think she was nowise invited either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t blame yourself too much, Joe,&rdquo; Courage interrupted, &ldquo;for
      if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Mammy has been always rather down upon you. No wonder
      that she wants to make amends. You&rsquo;re a perfect hero in all our eyes now,
      Joe. Just think of the terrible risk you ran and of all it has cost you,
      Joe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t cost me nuffin, Miss Courage,&rdquo; Joe said, almost angrily. &ldquo;Oh, I
      des hope for Brevet&rsquo;s sake dey won&rsquo;t be sayin&rsquo; any such foolish t&rsquo;ing as
      dat. I happen ter know dat Brevet would neber get over it if he thought he
      was &lsquo;sponsible for me lyin&rsquo; here in bed. No, Miss Courage, dat paralysis
      des happened ter come. I want it ter be so understood. I&rsquo;d had the
      queerest numb sort o&rsquo; feelin&rsquo;s creepin&rsquo; over me a whole week &lsquo;fo&rsquo; I took
      dat plunge <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>in
      de riber&mdash;but&mdash;-but, what I sent for you for am dis: I&rsquo;se had a
      heap o&rsquo; time, lyin&rsquo; heah, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;se been usin&rsquo; my eyes, an&rsquo; sure huff I hab
      an idea. You know your Sylvy? Well, she tol&rsquo; me dat day when ole Colonel
      Anderson an&rsquo; all of you were at Arlington, an&rsquo; we was clearin&rsquo; up de
      dinner dishes, dat she been ris up in an institution in Brooklyn, an&rsquo; so
      far as she knew she didn&rsquo;t hab a relashun in de worl&rsquo;. Now, do you happen
      ter know, Miss Courage, who took Sylvy to dat &lsquo;sylum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Joe; and I&rsquo;m quite sure Sylvia once told me that nobody knew; but if
      you wish, I can write and make some inquiry. But why do you want to know,
      Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, case I b&rsquo;lieve it isn&rsquo;t de mos&rsquo; impossible t&rsquo;ing in de worl&rsquo; dat
      Mammy and Sylvy is related,&rdquo; and Joe lowered his voice to an almost
      imperceptible whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whatever do you found that upon?&rdquo; Courage asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observation, Miss Courage, an&rsquo; what you might call human probability,&rdquo;
       (Joe was perfectly delighted to find two such fine long words at his
      command) &ldquo;an&rsquo; as I tol&rsquo; you, I&rsquo;se been usin&rsquo; my eyes lyin&rsquo; heah, an&rsquo; dey
      has little ways an&rsquo; gestures, Mammy and Sylvy, common to bof of &lsquo;em. Den
      you know Mammy had a daughter sol&rsquo; way from her des befo&rsquo; de <span
      class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>wah, an&rsquo; as
      Sylvy ain&rsquo;t no idea what name she was born to, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t impossible is it,
      dat she should be Mammy&rsquo;s gran&rsquo;chile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t impossible, Joe, but I must honestly say I do not think it
      probable. Just think how very little you really have to build upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty little, I grant you, Miss Courage, &lsquo;cepting dose little ways an&rsquo;
      gestures; but you&rsquo;ll write, won&rsquo;t you, case there ain&rsquo;t the least harm in
      writing is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed I will, Joe, this very night, but you mustn&rsquo;t hang too many
      hopes upon it, so as not to be too much disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;s hung dere already. Miss Courage,&rdquo; said incorrigible Joe, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;se
      not goin&rsquo;ter take &lsquo;em down till I has ter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed Courage. &ldquo;May I call Mammy back now? for I should
      like to see her for awhile before I go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you call her, an&rsquo; des you notice, now your &lsquo;tention&rsquo;s called ter it,
      if dere isn&rsquo;t some ways dat &lsquo;mind you of Sylvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Courage did notice, and was really so surprised at some points of
      resemblance, that she wrote her letter that night with a deeper conviction
      that they might be on the verge of a discovery than she had that morning
      thought possible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;BREVET SCORES A POINT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anybody going to die in this chapter?&rdquo; asked a little girl who is very
      dear to me, as we were reading aloud last evening. The chapter had
      certainly a rather ominous title, and if any one was going to die she
      preferred to go to bed. Now if we had happened to have been reading this
      story together, I am pretty sure I should have met the same question; for,
      what with Joe ill in bed, and Grandma Ellis ill at Ellismere, and both of
      them pretty old people, it does look, I admit, as though there might be
      something sad to write about it. But, happily, for that happy summer there
      was to be no sorrowful ending. Grandma Ellis was soon quite herself again,
      and Joe improved so much that it seemed as though he would probably be
      able to move about his cabin again some day. And so everything would have
      been bright and hopeful enough save for this&mdash;the time had come for
      Courage and the Bennetts and Mary Duff and Sylvia to go home, and all
      hearts as a result were as heavy as lead. The Bennetts were eager to <span
      class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>see their
      father and mother and the baby, but they did not want to go back to the
      great, crowded city. And Courage&mdash;well, she wondered what she
      possibly could find to do at home that would so absorb her whole thought
      and time as this Little Homespun household, and keep her half as happy and
      contented. She feared that when she went back, the old loneliness would
      surely come surging down upon her, and that life without Miss Julia would
      seem again intolerable. She was thinking just such sad thoughts as these
      as she sat alone in the little living-room, stitching away at a dress of
      Mary Bennett&rsquo;s that needed mending for the journey on the morrow. Every
      one but herself and Mary Duff had gone up to Arlington for a good-bye call
      upon Joe. Courage was not planning to go until late in the day,
      calculating that the afternoon mail would surely bring her some word from
      the asylum; and so, as she sat alone with her own sad thoughts, she was
      suddenly surprised by a little figure in the doorway and a larger figure
      looming above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s everybody?&rdquo; asked Brevet. &ldquo;May we come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, come in!&rdquo; Courage answered, cordially. &ldquo;Indeed, I am glad to
      see you, for I&rsquo;m as blue as can be.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a>"So are we,&rdquo; said Brevet, sitting
      disconsolately down in a huge armchair that made him look more
      disconsolate than ever &ldquo;Uncle Harry&rsquo;s hardly spoken to me all the way.&rdquo;
       Harry made no denial and dropped into the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be bluer still, Brevet, to find that no one&rsquo;s at home,&rdquo;
       Courage added. &ldquo;They have all gone up to Arlington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Brevet replied, philosophically, &ldquo;we shall
      see them all tomorrow when we come down to see you off; but what we all
      care the most about is your going, Miss Courage. Grand<i>na</i>na a cries
      every time she thinks of it, and Uncle Harry says it will be just like a
      funeral all the time for him until he is able to go back to the office,
      and I&rsquo;m just as miserable as I can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very kind of you all,&rdquo; sighed Courage. &ldquo;It seems to me there
      never were two such dear places as Homespun and Ellis-mere, and you cannot
      imagine how I hate to leave them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you all do anyway when you get back to New York?&rdquo; Brevet asked,
      a little sullenly, as though he felt in his heart that really they were to
      blame for going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are not going because we want to, Brevet,&rdquo; Courage answered
      almost sharply, <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108"
       id="link108"></a>for she was herself just down-spirited enough to be a
      trifle touchy and childish. &ldquo;There is no reason why Mary Duff and Sylvia
      and I should stay since the Bennetts will not be here to be cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the <i>reason</i> for your going home, Miss Courage?&rdquo; asked
      Brevet, determined to have the whole situation explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary Duff is needed at the hospital, where she has charge, you
      know, of a whole ward full of little babies; and, as for Sylvia and me,
      our home is there you know&mdash;we belong there&mdash;and I shall try
      very hard to find something to fill up all my time, for that is the only
      way for me to manage now that I no longer have Miss Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do people always belong to just one place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not always,&rdquo; Courage was forced to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you and Brevet seem to be having things all your own way,&rdquo; said
      Harry, really speaking for the first time since he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was thinking it would be more polite if you should join in the
      conversation,&rdquo; Courage answered, colouring a little, for she had felt
      annoyed at Harry&rsquo;s apparently moody silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, slowly, &ldquo;I do not know <span class="pagenum">109</span><a
      name="link109" id="link109"></a>on the whole that there is anything for me
      to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply to see you once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the use of that?&rdquo; Courage asked, she hardly knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, simply to enjoy the pathetic sort of pleasure of all last times;
      but I do not myself understand why you could not have stayed on and made
      us a visit? You would have made my grandmother very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harry, come off!&rdquo; said Brevet, who had unavoidably acquired a boy&rsquo;s
      measure of slang, and who was old enough to appreciate when Harry was not
      his frank, honest self. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all stuff about Grand<i>na</i>na&mdash;you
      want Miss Courage to stay for yourself just as much as Grand<i>na</i>na
      wants her for herself and I want her for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Children and fools speak the truth,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Harry, looking straight at
      Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the blessed beauty of them,&rdquo; looking straight back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people lack courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you. I know a fellow who feels that with Courage he
      could defy the whole world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brevet,&rdquo; said Courage, folding away the <span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a>mended dress, &ldquo;there is a pile of pictures
      yonder that I have been collecting from the magazines and papers for your
      scrap-book. Bring them here and let us look them over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet was not to be diverted. It was always one thing at a time with him.
      The pictures could wait&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t. He had one or two questions yet
      to ask, and he came and stood beside Courage as though to compel her
      undivided attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t you visit us? Didn&rsquo;t you want to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should have been glad to come, Brevet; I cannot explain to you why
      I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was because there wasn&rsquo;t anything particular for you to do;
      you always want to be doing something. Now, Miss Courage, I have heard
      Grand<i>na</i>na say that if Uncle Harry would bring a wife home to
      Ellismere some day she would give her all the housekeeping. Now, don&rsquo;t you
      think you could come that way, because then you would have a great deal to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not stop this child?&rdquo; said Courage, turning with a look of
      indignant appeal to Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is doing very well,&rdquo; Harry answered, without looking up. <span
      class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>Brevet,
      intent upon his own line of thought, paid not the least attention to
      either of the last remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Courage,&rdquo; resting one arm on her chair and speaking
      thoughtfully and slowly, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think you could&mdash;perhaps&mdash;be
      Uncle Harry&rsquo;s wife and so belong up to our house and have lots of things
      to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, couldn&rsquo;t you&mdash;perhaps?&rdquo; said Harry, very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage gave one glance toward Harry, and then sat gazing straight at
      Brevet with a look on her face as though endeavouring to frame some sort
      of answer; while Brevet, with appeal in his eyes more eloquent than words,
      waited in solemn silence for her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Brevet,&rdquo; she said, at last, &ldquo;are you sure, perfectly sure that your
      Uncle Harry would not mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sure!&rdquo; but not so much as looking toward Harry, so completely
      did he regard the matter as resting wholly between Courage and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Brevet, I believe I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time Brevet showed an inclination to include Harry in
      the conversation, but for that matter he had to, for Harry was close
      beside Courage now. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he <span class="pagenum">112</span><a
      name="link112" id="link112"></a>said, with a great sigh of relief, &ldquo;what
      did I tell you? Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t care enough to do it for you, but she
      cares enough to do it for us all three together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, Brevet!&rdquo; said Courage. &ldquo;See, there is Mary coming with the mail.
      Run, and bring it quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet scampered off in high feather, and Courage instantly straightened
      herself up and looked accusingly at Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you actually talked all this over with Brevet?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, never looking so handsome or so happy in his life. &ldquo;He
      talked it all over with me. He seemed to think it the one way out of the
      difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew he was&mdash;he was going to say all this to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never so much as dreamt it for a minute, I assure you, or that he
      was going to take matters into his own hands. On the contrary, I wanted to
      come alone this afternoon, but come he would. He had evidently thought out
      his own course of action, and I shall bless him for it all my life.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;A RED-LETTER AFTERNOON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey were a happy
      trio that set out for Arlington a half hour later. Harry and Courage
      walked closely, side by side, for there was much to be said that could not
      by any chance have any interest for Brevet; besides, you could not have
      kept Brevet still enough for five seconds together to listen to anything.
      He was quite as wild with joy as any little terrier, liberated from his
      kennel for the first run over the hills in a fortnight. But the joy that
      made him run hither and thither, and come bounding back to press a flower
      into Courage&rsquo;s hands, or simply to look up to her face, or brush
      affectionately against her in true terrier fashion, was something more
      than animal spirits. Courage was coming up to Ellismere to live! Courage
      was coming! No little May-time songster was ever more joyous over the
      coming of Spring, and Brevet would have trilled as glad a carol if he
      could. But of the three Courage was, if possible, the very happiest, for
      she had such a happy secret in her <span class="pagenum">114</span><a
      name="link114" id="link114"></a>keeping&mdash;that is, in her pocket&mdash;for
      the mail had brought the expected letter. The secret, however, must stay a
      secret until she should reach Arlington and could have a little private
      talk with Joe; and so she hurried Harry along much faster than was at all
      to his liking, for Harry would have been glad to have that walk last for
      &ldquo;a year and a day,&rdquo; and so perhaps would Courage, save for the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that it contained any wonderful revelation&mdash;it simply said
      that unfortunately the asylum authorities knew nothing more of Sylvia&rsquo;s
      antecedents than she herself knew; that she had simply been thrust in at
      the asylum door by some old woman who succeeded in beating a mysterious
      retreat into the darkness before any one had seen her. A scrap of paper
      pinned to her dress bore the name of Sylvia, and the statement that the
      child had neither father nor mother. In addition to this the only possible
      clew lay in two or three articles found at the time in Sylvia&rsquo;s keeping.
      They had been given to her when she left the institution, the matron
      impressing upon her the need and importance of guarding them carefully, as
      they would possibly prove of great value some day. They regretted very
      keenly that they were unable to furnish any further information. But,
      nevertheless, the letter stirred the first <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>real hope for Courage that Joe was right
      in his conjecture, for it reminded her of the little belongings Sylvia had
      once shown her&mdash;a coral necklace, a gay little silver belt set with
      imitation turquoise and rubies in great variety, and a much-used
      devotional book. She remembered there was no writing in the book save the
      name of what appeared to be some gentleman&rsquo;s country-place and some date
      way back in the fifties. She could not recall the name, but she thought
      she would know it if she heard it, and felt quite sure, now that she came
      to think of it, that she had heard a name on Mammy&rsquo;s lips that sounded
      like it. No wonder that something seemed far more important just then than
      even her own great happiness, and that she was impatient to reach Joe&rsquo;s
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hurry on,&rdquo; she said, when they came in sight of the cabin. &ldquo;You
      capture Brevet, Harry, and make him understand that he will be reduced to
      the ranks if he says one word down here of what has happened up at
      Homespun&mdash;your mother must be the first to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have set me a rather difficult task,&rdquo; laughed Harry; but he saw the
      wisdom of it, and bearing down upon Brevet he detained him an unwilling
      little prisoner until he had <span class="pagenum">116</span><a
      name="link116" id="link116"></a>extracted&mdash;but slowly and painfully
      it must be confessed&mdash;the required promise. Courage found the little
      cabin full; that is, Mary Duff, Sylvia and the children all were there as
      she expected, but a word to Mammy, to whom Courage&rsquo;s slightest wish was
      law, and the little cabin was cleared in a twinkling, all hands finding
      themselves peremptorily shooed like a pack of geese to the pond below,
      under some foolish pretext or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the letter come?&rdquo; Joe asked, breathlessly. &ldquo;Any news in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have a letter,&rdquo; and Courage drew a rocking-chair close to the bed;
      &ldquo;but there is nothing new in it, only it suggests something to me. It
      speaks of some treasures of Sylvia&rsquo;s that might throw a little light on
      the subject. I remember now that Sylvia once showed them to me, and I do
      not see why I have been so stupid as not to think of them before. They
      were a string of coral beads, a gay belt of some sort, and a little
      devotional book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; written in de book?&rdquo; interrupted Joe, his clasped hands
      trembling with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much, Joe. We mustn&rsquo;t grow too hopeful quite yet, but I am quite
      sure it was some name such as would belong to a gentleman&rsquo;s country-place,
      and I think I should <span class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117"
       id="link117"></a>recall it if I heard it. Now, doesn&rsquo;t Mammy sometimes
      speak of the plantation where she used to live, by some name or other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunnyside,&rdquo; panted Joe, &ldquo;Sunnyside; it&rsquo;s on her lips eb&rsquo;ry day or two. Do
      you t&rsquo;ink&mdash;do you t&rsquo;ink dat&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t dare to think, Joe, it would be so easy for me to be mistaken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Mammy then, call Sylvy,&rdquo; Joe cried, excitedly, &ldquo;call dem quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will call them right away, but, Joe, we must all try to be calm&rdquo;
       (for she feared the effect of so much excitement). &ldquo;You must be calm for
      your own sake, Joe, and for theirs, and if we should chance to be on the
      verge of a happy discovery, we must not spring it too suddenly upon them.
      Let me talk to them a little before you ask Sylvia about the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Courage in her own mind was quite joyously sure that Sunnyside was the
      name in the little book. Mammy and Sylvia came in answer to the call from
      Courage&mdash;Mary Duff and the Bennetts, wondering what was up, remained
      perforce just as obediently behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; said Courage, signalling Joe to be quiet for a moment, &ldquo;do you
      remember once showing me a little devotional book of yours? I was trying
      just now to remember its name.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">118</span><a
      name="link118" id="link118"></a>&ldquo;&lsquo;Words of Jesus,&rsquo; Miss Courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Words of Jesus,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mammy solemnly. &ldquo;Oh, but I loved dat little book.
      My Missus gave it to me years ago, an&rsquo; I gave it to my little girl when
      she was sol&rsquo; away from me way down in Alabama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Sylvia, there were some other little things, were there not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Courage, a little string of coral beads, and a tinsel belt, you
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe and Courage were looking straight at Mammy, who, ashy white under her
      dark skin, leaned against the foot of the bed; but Sylvia, all intent upon
      Joe, did not notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come nearer, chile,&rdquo; said Joe, for his turn had come now, although his
      voice all but failed him as he took Sylvia&rsquo;s hand in his. &ldquo;Was somethin&rsquo;
      written in de little book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvia, her own voice unsteady now, for she knew there must be
      some object in all this questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care now, Mammy,&rdquo; cried Joe, exultingly. &ldquo;Something may be going
      to happen, Mammy. Was it Sunnyside, chile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was Sunnyside,&rdquo; she answered, eagerly. &ldquo;What do you know about
      it, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before Joe could explain, Mammy&rsquo;s arms were about her in one wild
      ecstasy of delight, <span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119"
       id="link119"></a>and then dropping into a chair she drew Sylvia to her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0019" id="linkimage-0019"> </a>

      <a href="images/0155.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo; course it was Sunnyside, chile! what else could it be after yo&rsquo; sayin&rsquo;
      you owned de corals an&rsquo; de tinsel belt? I gave dem all three to my little
      daughter thirty years an&rsquo; more ago. Yo&rsquo; b&rsquo;longs ter me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mammy dear, who do you suppose I am?&rdquo; her arms close about Mammy&rsquo;s
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; my little gran&rsquo;chile, Honey, my little gran&rsquo;chile come back ter me
      after all dese years&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you be sure, Mammy? My having the things doesn&rsquo;t surely make
      me your grandchild,&rdquo; and Sylvia looked as though not to be able to be
      perfectly certain at last would quite break her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure by eb&rsquo;ryt&rsquo;ing &lsquo;bout you, Honey; by yo&rsquo; face, by yo&rsquo; hands, by de way
      you walk, by yo&rsquo; ebery motion, by de way you drink a cup o&rsquo; tea. Maria was
      jus&rsquo; about yo&rsquo; age when she was sol&rsquo; away from me, an&rsquo; sometimes you&rsquo;ve so
      much &lsquo;minded me of her I could scarce bear to look at you, neber dreamin&rsquo;
      you could possibly b&rsquo;long ter me. But, Sylvy,&rdquo; and Mammy&rsquo;s voice at once
      grew troubled with the thought that occurred to her, &ldquo;why hab you neber
      done try to fin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; own people, chile?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">120</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>"Why, Mammy! I knew nothing about myself
      at all. I was just pushed into the door of a coloured orphan asylum in
      Brooklyn, when I was a little bit of a girl, by a very old woman I
      remember, and I never saw or heard of her again. There was a little piece
      of paper pinned on to my dress which merely said, &lsquo;This little girl hasn&rsquo;t
      got any father or mother,&rsquo; and that my name was Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then yo&rsquo; mamma&rsquo;s daid, is she?&rdquo; said Mammy in a low voice, as though
      speaking to herself. &ldquo;I wonder who she married an&rsquo; how she drifted &lsquo;way up
      North, an&rsquo; why she never wrote to her old Mammy&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll never know
      in dis work, will we, Honey?&mdash;but no matter, no matter, we&rsquo;s got each
      oder now, Sylvy,&rdquo; and Mammy stroked Sylvia&rsquo;s hair with one trembling hand,
      as the happy realisation chased all the sadness from her face. &ldquo;Maria
      coaxed that little belt from me,&rdquo; she continued, never one moment taking
      her eyes from Sylvia&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;one day long &rsquo;fo&rsquo; she was sol&rsquo; from
      me. My Missus had given it to me when I was jus&rsquo; a slip of a girl. She
      gave me the dear book too, but I put that into Maria&rsquo;s pocket an&rsquo; begged
      her to read it now an&rsquo; again, cause Maria allers seemed too lighthearted
      to give much &rsquo;tention to religion. Seems as d&rsquo;ough <i>I</i> could
      hardly wait, Sylvy, <span class="pagenum">121</span><a name="link121"
       id="link121"></a>to lay my eyes on d&rsquo;ose little keepsakes once more. An&rsquo;,
      Sylvy chile, do you &lsquo;member what you said first words you spoke ter me an&rsquo;
      Joe? You said, &lsquo;I thought I should find some of my own people down here in
      Virginia.&rsquo; &lsquo;Lor, chile, you didn&rsquo;t dream what gospel trufes you were
      speakin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Harry and Brevet had appeared upon the scene, and astonished
      beyond measure at what they saw and heard, sat down on a bench beside the
      door and listened in mute wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who,&rdquo; said Mammy at last, when she could bring her confused thoughts
      into some sort of order, and with Sylvia still seated upon her lap, &ldquo;who
      was de one to find all dis out for me?&rdquo; turning toward Courage for an
      explanation. But Courage simply looked toward Joe for answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mammy,&rdquo; replied Joe, leaning comfortably back against his pillows,
      the embodiment of dusky radiance, &ldquo;I has dat honour, Mammy. Lyin&rsquo; here so
      helpless when I was first brought back ter de cabin, an&rsquo; watchin&rsquo; you an&rsquo;
      Sylvy move roun&rsquo; de room togeder, it came home ter me how you took after
      each oder in a hundred little ways, an&rsquo; den &rsquo;memberin&rsquo; how Sylvy
      had tol&rsquo; me one day how she knew nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout who b&rsquo;longed ter
      her, it <span class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>des
      &rsquo;spicioned me dat she might b&rsquo;long to you, an&rsquo; so Miss Courage
      here, she wrote up to de &rsquo;sylum an&rsquo; de answer des come dis bery
      afternoon. But o&rsquo; co&rsquo;se, as you know from Sylvy, dey couldn&rsquo;t tell us
      nuffin, but ter &rsquo;mind Miss Courage of de little treasures Sylvy had
      in her possession, an&rsquo; den Miss Courage &rsquo;minded how Sylvy had once
      showed dem to her an&rsquo; how dere was somethin&rsquo; written in de little book,
      but o&rsquo; co&rsquo;se we could not des be sure it was de same name as de ole
      plantation whar you lived till we sent for Sylvy an&rsquo; asked her. An&rsquo; oh!
      but it&rsquo;s a happy day for Joe; de happiest day in all my life, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all
      come of me being par&rsquo;lysed an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; a chance ter notice,&rdquo; and Joe spoke
      as though the paralysis was unquestionably something for which he had need
      to be devoutly thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mammy, who had left her chair and was standing close at his
      bedside, &ldquo;I&rsquo;se been hard on you an&rsquo; unfair to you mos&rsquo; o&rsquo; my life, Joe,&rdquo;
       and she stood looking down as shamefacedly as any little school culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say nuffin, Mammy. Hasn&rsquo;t I allers been hard on you an&rsquo; unfair
      to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t either of you say anything,&rdquo; interrupted Courage. &ldquo;If ever two
      people in this world have made up for bygones, I think you two people
      have,&rdquo; and Joe and Mammy shook <span class="pagenum">123</span><a
      name="link123" id="link123"></a>their old heads in assent, for happily for
      them both they knew that Courage had spoken but the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Brevet had slipped away and had enjoyed the exquisite pleasure of
      telling Mary Duff and the Bennetts the wonderful news, whereupon they had
      of course hurried pell-mell up to the cabin and joined in the general
      jubilation. It was well-nigh sunset before the good-byes were said&mdash;those
      last good-byes they had come for the purpose of saying&mdash;and before
      they were all started on their walk home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Courage turned to Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will run back and <i>just tell</i> Joe and Mammy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell all the world,&rdquo; said Harry, proudly, &ldquo;the sooner the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Courage appeared in the cabin doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she said, motioning to Mammy and hurrying to Joe&rsquo;s side.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another secret in the wind this afternoon, and I want to tell it
      to both of you myself. I think I shall come down here to live for good and
      all before <i>very</i> long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Lord be praised!&rdquo; ejaculated Joe and Mammy in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m coming because I am going to marry Harry Ellis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       <span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
      de Lord&rsquo;s own doin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; cried Joe, fervently, &ldquo;for we all need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never you fear but Sylvia will live here too,&rdquo; said Courage, turning
      radiantly to Mammy. Then in a flash she was gone to hurry after the little
      party over the road. With Harry and Brevet, Courage went straight up to
      Ellismere that night to see Grandma Ellis, and then another dear old heart
      was gladdened beyond all words by the good news she had to tell. The next
      day Courage went back to town with the Bennetts, leaving Sylvia to stay
      with Mammy until she should return, and Courage was to return before very
      long. A good deal had been talked over and arranged for in the evening
      spent at Ellismere, and among other things that there should be a wedding
      at Little Homespun late in October. By that time, probably, Joe would be
      able to drive up from Arlington, and Colonel Anderson would come down from
      Washington, and Courage knew that the Everetts and a few other dear
      friends would come down just as gladly from New York, and another matter
      that had been as fully agreed upon was, that although Courage&rsquo;s home was
      to be at Ellismere for the winter, she and Harry should move up to Little
      Homespun the coming summer, and Mary Duff should bring <span
      class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a>down some
      other party of little city-children to run wild and enjoy all the delights
      of the unknown country just as the little Bennetts had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that there was no real sadness in the good-byes which
      were said on the morrow&mdash;even the Bennetts found they were glad to
      go, now it came to the point, for when all is said, home is home the world
      over. Harry and Brevet drove up to Washington to see the little party off
      and then drove back to Ellismere, not saying much to each other by the
      way, but both very contented and happy. Brevet was humming his own
      favourite air, as in all serene and quiet moods, until at last as though
      to give vent to the joy within him he broke into the old words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;se a little Alabama Coon
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I hasn&rsquo;t been born very long-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; laughed Harry, interrupting, &ldquo;and a dear little coon into
      the bargain, and who has been born quite long enough to make the time
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Brevet, with puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mean you&rsquo;ve been born long enough to accomplish quite a great deal,
      on the whole, <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126"
       id="link126"></a>and the finest work you ever put in was up at Little
      Homespun yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about asking Miss Courage to come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I think your name will always stick to you now&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I
      shall never call you by any other&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean my name. Brevet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? I do not quite understand,&rdquo; for Brevet&rsquo;s ideas had really grown
      a little hazy as to the full meaning of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Joe gave you the name, you remember, because that is a title given
      in the army simply as a reward of merit. You have the honour, that is, of
      being a captain without the responsibility. Now it seems to me the title
      belongs to you more than ever since yesterday afternoon. You sailed right
      in and have won all the glory of persuading Miss Courage to come back to
      Virginia, but I do not see that you have assumed a grain of
      responsibility. It is a serious thing to have induced her to exchange her
      home for ours. Now who&rsquo;s going to see when she comes that she&rsquo;s always
      perfectly happy and contented, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the one to see to that, Uncle Harry. Isn&rsquo;t that what husbands
      have to do? Besides, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to blame me <span
      class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>when you
      yourself wanted her so much to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Blame!</i> bless your dear little heart! who thought of blame for a
      minute? Irresponsible little rascal though you be, you have earned your
      proud title and <i>Brevet</i> you shall be to the end of the chapter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brevet did not quite understand this either, but that did not matter. He
      knew that he had succeeded in making everybody very happy, Uncle Harry in
      particular, and for the present that was quite enough to know and to
      understand.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
